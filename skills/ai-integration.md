# AI Integration

Use this only when the current slice actually needs semantic retrieval, grounded Q&A, or bounded tool-driven automation. Default to search first, agent second, workflows or hosted agents last.

## Provider Activation Contract

`AiServices:Provider` is the sole activation source. Supported values come from the selected lane's declared provider set, with `None` as the default. Endpoint, deployment, connection-string, and runtime-availability values only validate the explicitly selected provider; they never activate Azure, OpenAI-compatible, or native local AI by presence. AppHost resources, runtime DI, `/api/v1/ai/status`, live-test eligibility, and operational remediation must use the same resolver and report the same provider token.

Foundry Local is an optional native-runtime arm, not an automatic fallback and not part of TaskFlow's current runnable proof. Generate the Foundry Local sections below only when the resource plan explicitly selects it. Otherwise omit its native package, host bootstrap, test project, settings, and runtime probes.

## Prerequisites

- [solution-structure.md](solution-structure.md)
- [bootstrapper.md](bootstrapper.md)
- [configuration-secrets.md](configuration-secrets.md)
- [identity-management.md](identity-management.md) (agents need auth context)
- [package-dependencies.md](package-dependencies.md)

### Optional Local Runtime Prerequisites

For a real local AI run, verify the substrate before debugging application code:

```powershell
dotnet --version
docker info                 # or podman info
aspire --version            # install: dotnet tool install -g Aspire.Cli
func --version              # optional Functions run: npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
```

When Foundry Local was explicitly selected, the SDK-direct API-host path needs **no Foundry CLI or runtime on `PATH`** - `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` is self-contained and downloads its execution providers and the model alias (`qwen2.5-0.5b`) on first run. The `foundry` CLI checks below apply only to the **future** `RunAsFoundryLocal()` path (after the Aspire fix):

```powershell
foundry --version           # install: winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal
foundry service status
foundry model info qwen2.5-0.5b
foundry model download qwen2.5-0.5b
```

Notes:

- `foundry model list` can log catalog-processing errors on some Foundry Local versions even when explicit model lookup works; treat `foundry model info <alias>` plus `foundry service status` as the pragmatic verification path (future `RunAsFoundryLocal()` path only).
- Use a local model whose task list includes `tools` when any `ChatClientAgent` or FlowEngine agent node will call functions. `qwen2.5-0.5b` is small and supports `chat, tools`; `phi-4` is `chat` only.
- The first SDK-direct run downloads the `qwen2.5-0.5b` alias; expect added latency on the first AppHost run (the SDK manages the download - no separate pre-download step).
- Fully local model run: explicitly select `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal`, then run `dotnet run --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost`. The **target** path is Aspire `RunAsFoundryLocal()`; while it is broken against GA Foundry Local (see *Aspire Integration* -> *Known issue*), the **temporary** local path is the SDK-direct API-host bootstrap. See *SDK-direct API-host bootstrap (temporary workaround)*.
- Real Azure Foundry run: explicitly select `AiServices:Provider=AzureInference` and supply its required endpoint/deployment configuration in AppHost user secrets or configuration. `aspire publish` preserves that explicit selection; raw endpoint presence never selects the provider.
- Add the AppHost SQL password secret before launch when the AppHost has a secret `sql-password` parameter:
  ```powershell
  dotnet user-secrets init --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
  dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:sql-password" "<StrongPassword>" --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
  ```

## Non-Negotiables

1. All AI services behind interfaces - testable, swappable.
2. Embedding generation is infrastructure, not domain.
3. Agent function tools delegate to existing `I{Entity}Service` application services - no domain logic in tools.
4. Search indexes are projections, not source of truth.
5. Use `DefaultAzureCredential` for Foundry/Search auth (no API keys in code). In production, prefer `ManagedIdentityCredential`.
6. Configuration-driven model selection (appsettings, not hardcoded deployment names).
7. Use **Microsoft Agent Framework** (`Microsoft.Agents.AI`) - the successor to Semantic Kernel and AutoGen. Do not scaffold with Semantic Kernel or AutoGen packages.
8. Scope each `AgentSession` by tenant, user, and conversation; never share across any boundary. **Why:** A session carries conversation and tool state, so reuse can expose prior-user context or interleave concurrent turns. Therefore session storage and lookup keys include all three dimensions.
9. Start with one agent and a small tool set. Do not scaffold multi-agent orchestration until a single-agent path is proven insufficient.
10. System prompts live in files, not inline string literals spread through services.
11. **Read the DTO/response source before writing property access against it (GR-18).** The AI surface hits this often - assuming a property such as `snapshot.PreferredLanguage` that the type does not expose. `read_file` the DTO before generating tool wrappers or snapshot records.
12. **Read the target class constructor before injecting new dependencies into generated agents or tool classes (GR-18).** Generated constructors drift from session notes; reading the actual signature first avoids the compile errors called out in the rule.
13. **Scaffold mode is the default.** AI Search is `deployment-only` (no local emulator). `AiServices:Provider=None` registers no-op stubs, including a no-op `IChatClient`, so the app boots without cloud credentials. Generate Azure, OpenAI-compatible, or Foundry Local runtime wiring only for an explicitly selected provider; record any deployment-only dependency in `HANDOFF.md`.
14. **Function-tool schemas must be provider-compatible.** Avoid nullable optional tool parameters such as `string? status = null` when targeting Azure AI Inference / Foundry Local. `AIFunctionFactory` can emit JSON Schema union types like `["string","null"]`, and some inference endpoints reject them. Prefer non-null optional strings with empty defaults (`string status = ""`) or explicit DTOs with provider-safe schema.
15. **AI provider contract explicit.** Provider selection comes only from `AiServices:Provider`; raw connection strings, endpoints, deployments, and local runtime availability validate that selection but never change it. AppHost, runtime DI, status, live tests, and docs share one resolver. No-op is allowed for non-live AI tests and offline boot only. Live AI tests never green on `none` or `stub`.

---

## Pragmatic Defaults

1. **Search-only first** when the requirement is findability, retrieval, or grounded Q&A over existing data.
2. **Single agent second** when the model must choose among a few application-service tools.
3. **Workflows last** when the process is durable, branching, resumable, or needs explicit approvals/checkpoints.
4. **Server-hosted Foundry agents only when justified** by hosted memory, centralized tool catalogs, portal/IaC-managed agent definitions, or operational requirements a code-hosted agent cannot meet. Server-hosted agents (Aspire `AddPromptAgent`, or pre-existing agents driven by the client SDK) always require Azure - start code-hosted.
5. **Keyword or semantic search before vector or hybrid**. Add embeddings only when search quality testing shows a clear gap.
6. **Do not scaffold empty AI folders**. Add only the Search, Agents, and Workflows folders that are enabled.

## Decision Order

- **Need retrieval over business data?** Start with Azure AI Search.
- **Need the model to call internal business operations?** Add one `ChatClientAgent` with a few function tools that delegate to existing application services.
- **Need long-running or branching AI processes?** Add `Microsoft.Agents.Workflows`.
- **Need hosted memory, portal/IaC-managed agent definitions, or Foundry-managed tools?** Use a server-hosted Foundry agent (Aspire `AddProject` + `AddPromptAgent`, or a pre-existing agent via the client SDK) after the simpler code-hosted path is proven insufficient.

## Technology Choices

- **Foundry Models / Azure OpenAI client:** default model host for completions, embeddings, and tool-calling.
- **Azure AI Search:** default retrieval tier.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework:** default code-side agent SDK (`ChatClientAgent` over the injected `IChatClient`).
- **Foundry projects + server-hosted agents:** optional hosted agent backend - Aspire `AddProject` + `AddPromptAgent`, or a pre-existing portal/IaC agent consumed via `AIProjectClient.AsAIAgent(...)`. Azure-only.
- **Agent Framework Workflows:** optional explicit orchestration layer.

Useful primitives:
- `ChatClientAgent` (`Microsoft.Agents.AI`) for the default single-agent path
- `AIFunctionFactory.Create()` (`Microsoft.Extensions.AI`) for application-service tools
- `AsAIAgent()` (`OpenAI.Chat` extension in `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI` package) to create a `ChatClientAgent` from a `ChatClient`
- `AgentSession` for per-conversation state
- `Microsoft.Agents.Workflows` for explicit orchestration only when needed

---

## Packages

- Baseline for any AI capability (Aspire Foundry path):
    - `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry` (AppHost) - when no stable release exists, resolve the latest compatible prerelease and document the temporary exception
    - `Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference` (host project) - same prerelease rule; provides the `IChatClient`
    - `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` - `IChatClient`, `AIFunctionFactory`
    - `Microsoft.Agents.AI` - `ChatClientAgent`
    - `Azure.Identity` - managed identity for real Azure
- Add only when enabled:
    - `Azure.Search.Documents` + `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Search` for search
    - `Azure.AI.OpenAI` only if a component needs the Azure OpenAI client directly (embeddings, a FlowEngine Azure-OpenAI connector)
    - `Azure.AI.Projects` + `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Foundry` when consuming a Foundry **project** or **server-hosted/pre-existing agent** from app code (the `AIProjectClient.AsAIAgent(...)` path). If only a prerelease exists, use the latest compatible prerelease under the temporary-exception rule.
    - `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` + `OpenAI` + `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI` (API host only) - conditional SDK-direct local-dev workaround only when the latest stable Aspire path reproduces dotnet/aspire#12750. Resolve latest stable packages, set `RuntimeIdentifiers`, and reference the native package with `PrivateAssets="all"`. `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI` provides `.AsIChatClient()` over the OpenAI client. Remove all three when the preferred Aspire path passes the live lane. See *SDK-direct API-host bootstrap (temporary workaround)*.
    - `Microsoft.Agents.Workflows` for workflow orchestration

Resolve packages at generation time and record concrete versions in `Directory.Packages.props`. Prefer latest stable. When a required package has no stable release, record the issue, prerelease reason, removal condition, and validating test beside the resolved prerelease. The SDK-direct local path uses the latest stable Foundry Local SDK and remains only while the preferred Aspire live lane reproduces dotnet/aspire#12750.

## Agent Patterns

### Simple Agent (ChatClientAgent)

This is the default agent pattern. Wrap an Azure OpenAI / Foundry model with a small number of function tools that delegate to existing application services.

Generate the code-hosted interface, request/response contracts, `ChatClientAgent` service, bounded application-service tools, prompt, scoped registration, and optional endpoint from [agent-template.md](../templates/agent-template.md) -> *Agent Interface*, *Default Agent Service*, *Prompt File*, *DI Registration*, and *API Endpoint*. That template owns the generated code shape, session creation, `UseTools` control, and cancellation propagation. Keep provider selection outside the agent: inject the `IChatClient` chosen by *DI Registration* and *Aspire Integration* below.

### Escalate Only When Needed

- **Middleware:** add only after the core run path works and there is a concrete need for logging, redaction, authorization, or safety interception.
- **Agent-as-tool composition:** add only when one agent owns a distinct bounded capability that should stay isolated from the outer agent.
- **Server-hosted Foundry agents:** use only when server-side memory, hosted tools, or centralized/portal-managed agent definitions are real requirements. See *Foundry Projects and Server-Hosted Agents* below.
- **Workflows:** use only for branching, resumable, or human-in-the-loop flows. Do not introduce workflows for a single linear task.

If you add one of these escalations, keep the first pass narrow: one middleware policy, one subordinate agent, or one workflow path.

---

## Search Patterns

### Search Rollout Order

1. Start with keyword or semantic search.
2. Add vector search only if search-quality testing shows that lexical or semantic ranking is inadequate.
3. Add hybrid search only after both lexical and vector behavior are individually understood.

### Azure AI Search Shape

Generate the search interface/mode, projection and result models, `SearchClient` implementation, settings, and index setup from [ai-search-template.md](../templates/ai-search-template.md) -> *Search Service Interface*, *Search Document Model*, *Search Result Model*, *Default Search Service*, *Relevant Settings*, and *Index Setup*. That template owns the generated query-option shapes. Keep registration and optional configuration semantics in *DI Registration* and *Configuration (appsettings)* below. Do not generate vector fields, vector queries, or vector index configuration until search-quality evidence justifies embeddings.

### Vectorization Pipeline

#### On-Write (Domain Event Handler)

- Use an event handler only when search freshness matters enough to justify write-path work.
- Index only projection fields plus the vector field. Always keep the primary entity ID in the document.
- Call a dedicated embedding service abstraction from the handler or job. Do not generate embeddings in domain code.

#### Batch (Function App / Scheduler)

Use when vectorizing large existing datasets or when eventual consistency is acceptable. Prefer batch backfill first when introducing embeddings to an existing system.

## DI Registration

AI services use conditional registration - absent config -> no-op stubs registered, app boots without cloud credentials.

The gate applies to every optional provider (AI, Graph, external identity): registration checks the **complete** credential set, not a single key, and constructs the credential object at registration time so misconfiguration fails at startup. Gating on one key (e.g. ClientId alone) wires the real client when the rest is missing, defeating the no-op fallback with a first-resolve exception deep in a request path.

```csharp
public static class AiServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    // environment gates the opt-in dev-stub tier (Development only); callers pass builder.Environment.
    public static IServiceCollection AddAiServices(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IHostEnvironment environment)
    {
        var aiSection = config.GetSection(AiSettings.ConfigSectionName);
        services.AddOptions<AiSettings>()
            .Bind(aiSection)
            .ValidateDataAnnotations()
            .ValidateOnStart();

        var settings = aiSection.Get<AiSettings>() ?? new AiSettings();

        // The model client (IChatClient) is registered at the HOST via Aspire (see Aspire section).
        // Its presence - not raw config - gates live AI here.
        var hasChatClient = services.Any(d => d.ServiceType == typeof(IChatClient));

        // Azure AI Search (if configured) - Search has no local emulator (deployment-only).
        if (settings.UseSearch && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(settings.SearchEndpoint))
        {
            services.AddSingleton(new SearchClient(
                new Uri(settings.SearchEndpoint),
                settings.SearchIndexName,
                new DefaultAzureCredential()));

            services.AddScoped<IProjectSearchService, ProjectSearchService>();
        }
        else if (settings.UseSearch)
        {
            // TODO: [CONFIGURE] AI Search endpoint - set AiServices:SearchEndpoint for live search
            services.AddScoped<IProjectSearchService, NoOpSearchService>();
        }

        // Opt-in dev-stub: a deterministic IChatClient for manual local runs/demos, so the agent and
        // AI surfaces render populated content with no model. Development-only, off by default, and only
        // when no live provider was wired. Never a deployed environment (see Configuration -> DevStubContent).
        var devStub = !hasChatClient && settings.DevStubContent && environment.IsDevelopment();
        var usableChatClient = hasChatClient || devStub;

        // Agent services - once the agent feature exists, live behavior follows a usable IChatClient.
        // Without a model (and no dev-stub), keep the no-op stub so local scaffold runs still boot.
        if (usableChatClient)
            services.AddScoped<ISupportTriageAgent, SupportTriageAgentService>();
        else
            services.AddScoped<ISupportTriageAgent, NoOpSupportTriageAgent>();

        // IChatClient fallback so AI endpoints/consumers resolve and the app boots offline.
        if (devStub)
            services.AddSingleton<IChatClient, StubContentChatClient>(); // deterministic dev/demo content
        else if (!hasChatClient)
            services.AddSingleton<IChatClient, NoOpChatClient>();

        // Provider signal for GET /api/v1/ai/status. Each IChatClient bootstrap branch (Azure host path,
        // SDK-direct local path) already registered AiProviderInfo("azure"|"local"); the dev-stub path
        // records "stub". TryAddSingleton keeps whichever was set and falls back to "none" when no
        // provider was wired (the no-op case above).
        if (devStub)
            services.TryAddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("stub"));
        services.TryAddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("none")); // Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Extensions

        return services;
    }
}
```

No-op stubs return empty results or a `Result.Failure("AI service not configured")` and log a warning; never-throw rule and safe-default table: [../templates/no-op-stub-template.md](../templates/no-op-stub-template.md). Scaffold `AiProviderInfo` and the `GET /api/v1/ai/status` endpoint **by default** whenever `includeAiServices: true` - it is the live-lane gate (see *Testing*) and an ops signal, and is easy to skip because the agents work without it.

**Runtime synthesized content is deliberately not a default.** The honest default with no provider wired is the no-op contract - empty results, `AiProviderInfo("none")`, `isConfigured: false` - so an offline boot never fabricates content that looks like model output. Fast test tiers do not need this default to be populated: they inject a deterministic fake `IChatClient` (see *Testing* -> *Provider Test Tiers*), so they already assert full response contracts with no model. The one gap that justifies more is the **manual** local run / demo (a real `dotnet run` / Aspire boot, where no fake is injected): with no provider it shows empty AI surfaces. The opt-in `AiServices:DevStubContent` flag (above) closes only that gap - Development-only, off by default, registering a small deterministic `StubContentChatClient` (the same deterministic-stand-in shape the test tiers use, promoted to an opt-in app registration, not a second generator). It surfaces as a distinct provider `stub` via `GET /api/v1/ai/status`, so a UI can banner it as synthesized and it is never mistaken for a model. Deterministic tests assert `stub` as `isConfigured: false`; optional live tests apply the eligibility matrix below and never treat synthesized content as a model. Leave it off unless a populated local/demo experience is actually wanted.

**Multi-host wiring.** When more than one host consumes AI (e.g. API and Functions), factor the provider selection into one shared path both hosts call - do not duplicate the Azure/local/no-op branch in each `Program.cs`. Register the AI consumer services (`AddAiServices` - agents, demos, the `AiProviderInfo` fallback) through the shared Bootstrapper as a feature-scoped `Register{Ai}Services` extension with per-host opt-in, per [bootstrapper.md](bootstrapper.md) (Conditional Per-Host Dependency Pattern); keep the host-builder client bootstrap (the Azure `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient`, or the async SDK-direct local bootstrap, both of which are host/RID-bound) in one shared routine the opting-in hosts share. The inline `Program.cs` examples above are the single-host shorthand.

---

## Configuration (appsettings)

```json
{
  "AiServices": {
    "Provider": "None",
    "UseSearch": true,
    "UseAgents": false,
    "UseVectorSearch": false,
    "DisableFoundryLocal": true,
    "RequireFoundryLocal": false,
    "LocalModel": "qwen2.5-0.5b",
    "LocalWebUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:52415",
    "DevStubContent": false,
    "FoundryEndpoint": "https://ai-foundry-{resource}.services.ai.azure.com/",
    "AgentModelDeployment": "gpt-4o-deploy",
    "EmbeddingModelDeployment": "embedding-deploy",
    "SearchEndpoint": "https://{search-resource}.search.windows.net",
    "SearchIndexName": "products-index",

    "FoundryResourceName": "",
    "FoundryResourceGroup": "",
    "FoundryProjectEndpoint": "",
    "FoundryAgentName": ""
  }
}
```

Endpoint keys configure their axis after `AiServices:Provider` selects it. `FoundryEndpoint` configures the Azure inference path but does not select it. `FoundryResourceName` + `FoundryResourceGroup` target an **existing** Azure Foundry account (the `RunAsExisting`/`PublishAsExisting` parameters). `FoundryProjectEndpoint` + `FoundryAgentName` drive the **server-hosted/pre-existing agent** client path (`AIProjectClient.AsAIAgent(...)`). All four are empty by default and inactive until their provider/capability is explicitly selected.

`DisableFoundryLocal` is a defense-in-depth local-bootstrap guard, default `true`. `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal` is still required to activate the local arm; setting the guard to `false` alone does nothing. RID-free/offline test tiers keep it `true` on every API boot path. Unlike the other keys here, it is **read host-side via `config.GetValue<bool>("AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal")` in `Program.cs`, not bound on `AiSettings`** because it gates the RID-bound host bootstrap before shared settings binding.

`DevStubContent` is the manual-local/demo **opt-in** (default `false`). When `true`, in a Development environment, and only when no live provider (Azure or Foundry Local) was wired, the API registers a deterministic `StubContentChatClient` instead of the no-op client and records `AiProviderInfo("stub")` - so a real `dotnet run`/Aspire boot renders populated AI surfaces without a model. It has no effect outside Development, no effect when a real provider is wired, and never greens a live smoke (`stub` is treated like `none`; see *DI Registration* and *Testing* -> *Provider Test Tiers*). Leave it `false` to keep the honest empty/`isConfigured: false` state.

`RequireFoundryLocal` is a live-test host knob, default `false`. It is valid only when `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal`; set both only in `Test.FoundryLocal` so SDK bootstrap failure reaches the test harness for classification. Missing/undiscoverable runtime -> `Assert.Inconclusive`; installed/discovered runtime that falls back to no-op, fails startup, returns bad HTTP or an invalid/missing contract, or reports wrong `/api/v1/ai/status` -> `Assert.Fail`. A healthy provider (`provider: local`, `isConfigured: true`) whose model generation exceeds the bounded per-request budget is `Assert.Inconclusive` - that is machine capacity, not a contract failure. `{APP}_RUN_FOUNDRY_LOCAL_TESTS=false` remains a fast explicit opt-out, not a prerequisite when the optional runtime is absent. `LocalModel` and `LocalWebUrl` feed the SDK-direct bootstrap.

> **Stub rule:** Generate all AI settings with `// TODO: [CONFIGURE]` comments. Use empty strings for endpoints - never hardcode real URLs.

---

## Aspire Integration (Azure AI Foundry)

Only wire AI resources through Aspire if the solution already uses an AppHost. Do not introduce Aspire solely for AI.

> **Conditional known issue - dotnet/aspire#12750.** Test the latest stable `RunAsFoundryLocal()` path first. If it injects an empty endpoint or fails current runtime discovery, record the reproduction, use the SDK-direct API-host bootstrap below temporarily, and keep `Test.FoundryLocal` as the validating test. Removal condition: the preferred Aspire path passes provider-status and live completion tests on the current runtime. The Azure path (`AddFoundry` provision/existing + `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat")` over `ConnectionStrings:chat`) is unaffected.

Use the Foundry hosting integration (`Aspire.Hosting.Foundry`) for the **Azure path** - it provisions Foundry on publish and connects to it in run mode. If this package or the Inference client has no stable release, resolve the latest compatible prerelease and apply the four-part temporary-exception record in `Directory.Packages.props`. The deployment resource name (`"chat"` below) is the connection name consumers bind to. A reproduced local-path issue uses the SDK-direct workaround with no `chat` Aspire resource until the preferred path passes again.

### Two axes: lifecycle x consumption

"Aspire Foundry" is two independent choices. Keeping them apart removes the confusion:

- **Axis 1 - where the Foundry resource comes from** (the `AddFoundry` lifecycle).
- **Axis 2 - what you consume** (raw model inference vs. a project + server-hosted agents).

**Axis 1 - lifecycle** (`FoundryResource : AzureProvisioningResource`, so the general `Aspire.Hosting.Azure` existing-resource APIs apply):

| Mode | AppHost call | Result | Azure? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundry Local - `RunAsFoundryLocal` (preferred, target) | `AddFoundry("foundry").RunAsFoundryLocal().AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.Local.Qwen2505b)` | Runs the model on-device and injects `ConnectionStrings:chat`. Test this current path first; use the fallback only if dotnet/aspire#12750 reproduces. | No |
| Foundry Local - `sdk-direct-api-host` (temporary, conditional) | With `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal`, add no `AddFoundry` resource; the API host drives `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` directly. Offline / RID-free tiers select `None` and retain `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal=true`. | **Temporary workaround** only when native local AI was explicitly requested - no `chat` resource, no `ConnectionStrings:chat`. See *SDK-direct API-host bootstrap*. | No |
| Provision new | `AddFoundry("foundry").AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt4oMini)` | Bicep creates the account + deploys the model on publish (and in run mode when `Azure:SubscriptionId/ResourceGroupPrefix/Location` provisioning secrets are set). | Yes (your sub) |
| Connect to existing | `AddFoundry("foundry").RunAsExisting(nameParam, rgParam)` (also `PublishAsExisting`, `AsExisting`) then `.AddDeployment("chat", ...)` | Points at an account you already provisioned; provisions nothing. The deployment name must match a model already deployed there. | Yes (existing) |
| Disabled | (no `AddFoundry`) | No `chat` resource is wired; app registers no-op AI services. | No |

**Axis 2 - consumption:** raw inference (`IChatClient` over a `FoundryDeploymentResource`, below) is the default and works with all three lifecycle modes. Projects + server-hosted agents are an escalation - see *Foundry Projects and Server-Hosted Agents*.

```csharp
// AppHost. Explicit provider selection is the only activation source.
IResourceBuilder<FoundryDeploymentResource>? chat = null;
var provider = builder.Configuration["AiServices:Provider"] ?? "None";

if (string.Equals(provider, "AzureInference", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
    // Validate the required endpoint/deployment for this arm before adding resources.
    chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry").AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt4oMini);

    // Connect to an EXISTING Azure Foundry account instead of provisioning a new one:
    // the deployment "chat" must already exist in that account. RunAsExisting binds in run
    // mode; PublishAsExisting binds the published graph. Parameters resolve from config/secrets.
    // var name = builder.AddParameter("foundry-name");
    // var rg = builder.AddParameter("foundry-rg");
    // chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry").RunAsExisting(name, rg)
    //     .AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt4oMini);
}
// FoundryLocal: no chat resource while RunAsFoundryLocal() is broken. Preserve the explicit
// provider value for the API host's conditional SDK-direct bootstrap. None: wire no provider.
// Reject unknown provider tokens before graph construction.

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApp_Api>("api");

// Azure: wire the deployment (ConnectionStrings:chat + CHAT_* env). FoundryLocal: the API host
// enters SDK-direct bootstrap only because the explicit provider token says so. RID-free test
// graphs select None and keep AiServices__DisableFoundryLocal=true as defense in depth.
if (chat is not null)
    api = api.WithReference(chat);
```

Register the **Azure-path** client at the **host** (`IHostApplicationBuilder`, not the `IServiceCollection` AI extension). The `connectionName` must equal the deployment resource name; this runs only when an Azure `chat` deployment was wired. The local workaround instead registers `IChatClient` via the SDK-direct bootstrap (see *SDK-direct API-host bootstrap (temporary workaround)*):

```csharp
// Program.cs - Azure path: run only when the AppHost wired a "chat" reference.
// Local workaround sets IChatClient via the SDK-direct bootstrap; absent both, AddAiServices adds a no-op.
if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("chat")))
{
    builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat").AddChatClient(); // registers Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient
    builder.Services.AddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("azure"));    // record provider for /api/v1/ai/status (see Testing)
}
```

`AddAiServices` then gates live AI on **IChatClient presence** (not raw config) and registers a no-op `IChatClient` when none was wired, so demos/endpoints resolve and the app boots offline:

```csharp
var hasChatClient = services.Any(d => d.ServiceType == typeof(IChatClient));
if (hasChatClient)
    services.AddScoped<IAssistantAgent, AssistantAgentService>();
else
    services.AddScoped<IAssistantAgent, NoOpAssistantAgent>();
if (!hasChatClient)
    services.AddSingleton<IChatClient, NoOpChatClient>();
```

Build agents as a `ChatClientAgent` over the injected `IChatClient` (Microsoft Agent Framework), not over an `AzureOpenAIClient`. Keep an `AzureOpenAIClient` registration only if a component needs it directly (e.g. a FlowEngine Azure-OpenAI connector or embedding generation) - it is independent of the `IChatClient` chat/agent path.

```csharp
_agent = new ChatClientAgent(chatClient, instructions: systemPrompt, name: "Assistant", tools: [ /* AIFunctionFactory.Create(...) */ ]);
```

For embeddings or AI Search, add `builder.AddAzureSearch("search")` and reference it the same way; Search has no local emulator, so it stays `deployment-only` with a no-op stub.

Copy-paste configuration examples:

```powershell
# Fully local model run (SDK-direct host bootstrap - NOT RunAsFoundryLocal(); see Known issue).
$env:AiServices__Provider = "FoundryLocal"
$env:AiServices__DisableFoundryLocal = "false"
dotnet run --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
# Explicit no-op for offline / fast iteration:
$env:AiServices__Provider = "None"; $env:AiServices__DisableFoundryLocal = "true"; dotnet run --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost

# Real Azure Foundry local run
dotnet user-secrets set "AiServices:Provider" "AzureInference" --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "AiServices:FoundryEndpoint" "https://<your-foundry-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/" --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
dotnet run --project src/Host/Aspire/AppHost
```

If the target Azure environment requires keyless managed-identity inference instead of the generated connection secret, update the host-side `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat")` registration to use the required credential overload. Do that before classifying failures as model or prompt failures.

### SDK-direct API-host bootstrap (temporary workaround)

> **This is a temporary workaround, not the target architecture.** Use it only while the preferred path (`RunAsFoundryLocal()`) is broken (see *Known issue*). When Aspire ships the fix, migrate back per *Migration: restoring `RunAsFoundryLocal()`* below.

> Resolve the latest stable `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` package before using this illustrative snippet, then run the RID-bound `Test.FoundryLocal` live lane. SDK surfaces can shift; compile and live-provider evidence, not this snippet, decide whether the current API shape is valid.

In this mode the **AppHost wires no Foundry/`chat` resource at all** - there is no `AddFoundry`, no `RunAsFoundryLocal()`, and **no `ConnectionStrings:chat`**. The API host references the resolved latest stable `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` SDK and drives it directly. The Azure path is untouched and stays on Aspire - `AddFoundry` (provision/existing) + host-side `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat")` over `ConnectionStrings:chat`.

**Temporary-exception record:** issue: dotnet/aspire#12750 reproduced on the latest stable Aspire path; reason: direct SDK bootstrap restores current runtime discovery; removal: preferred `RunAsFoundryLocal()` passes again; validating test: RID-bound `Test.FoundryLocal` provider-status and live completion lane.

**AppHost (local workaround branch).** Only `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal` enters this branch. Wire no `chat` resource while the workaround is active; preserve the explicit provider value for the API host. RID-free testing selects `None` and keeps the defense-in-depth opt-out:

```csharp
// AppHost. AzureInference stays on Aspire (provision/existing -> ConnectionStrings:chat).
// FoundryLocal is explicit and wires no Foundry/chat resource until RunAsFoundryLocal() works.
// None wires no provider resources.
//
// A RID-free TESTING AppHost selects None and keeps the local guard enabled (see Testing):
//   api = api.WithEnvironment("AiServices__Provider", "None");
//   api = api.WithEnvironment("AiServices__DisableFoundryLocal", "true");
```

**Packaging (API host `.csproj`).** `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` is a native, self-contained package - it needs a RID and must not flow transitively:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x64;linux-x64;osx-arm64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- TEMPORARY workaround refs - remove when Aspire RunAsFoundryLocal() is restored (see Migration).
       PrivateAssets=all keeps the native package out of downstream refs.
       Issue: dotnet/aspire#12750. Remove when the preferred path passes Test.FoundryLocal. -->
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local" PrivateAssets="all" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenAI" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI" /> <!-- .AsIChatClient() over the OpenAI client -->
</ItemGroup>
```

**The RID-bound test lane needs its own direct reference.** The native payload (`Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.Core`) ships in a separate RID-bound transitive package, and `PrivateAssets="all"` deliberately stops it flowing into downstream refs - including an in-process `WebApplicationFactory` test host that references the API host project. So the `Test.FoundryLocal` lane (see *Testing* -> *Deciding the Live Lane*) must declare its **own** direct `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` `PackageReference` plus matching `RuntimeIdentifiers`; it cannot inherit the native payload transitively. The RID-free fast tiers never reference it.

**Bootstrap (API host `Program.cs`).** Enter the native bootstrap only for explicit `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal`. A selected provider that cannot start fails fast; it must not silently become no-op. Optional live-test classification happens before host creation. Everything downstream (`AddAiServices` gating, `ChatClientAgent`) is unchanged because it keys off `IChatClient` presence - there is no `ConnectionStrings:chat` to read in this mode:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local;                // FoundryLocalManager, Configuration
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;                   // AddChatClient, AsIChatClient (via Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI)
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions; // NullLogger
using OpenAI;                                    // OpenAIClient
using System.ClientModel;                        // ApiKeyCredential

// TEMPORARY explicitly selected local-dev workaround - replaced by RunAsFoundryLocal().
var selectedProvider = builder.Configuration["AiServices:Provider"] ?? "None";
var localSelected = string.Equals(selectedProvider, "FoundryLocal", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
// Host-read on purpose (not a bound AiSettings property): this gates the RID-bound host bootstrap,
// which runs before the RID-free Infrastructure.AI settings binding. Tradeoff: no bind-time
// validation, so a typo in the key silently no-ops - keep the spelling exact. (See Configuration.)
var disableLocal = builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>("AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal");
if (localSelected)
{
    if (disableLocal)
        throw new InvalidOperationException("FoundryLocal was selected while AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal is true.");

        // Web bind config is REQUIRED before StartWebServiceAsync(), or it throws "Web service
        // configuration was not provided." Port 0 = ephemeral. This is the INPUT bind address; the
        // ACTUAL bound endpoint comes from manager.Urls after startup (do not reuse this value).
        var foundryConfig = new Configuration
        {
            AppName = appName,
            Web = new Configuration.WebService { Urls = "http://127.0.0.1:0" }
        };
        await FoundryLocalManager.CreateAsync(foundryConfig, NullLogger.Instance); // returns Task (void)
        var manager = FoundryLocalManager.Instance;                               // get the singleton, not a return value

        var catalog = await manager.GetCatalogAsync();
        var model = await catalog.GetModelAsync("qwen2.5-0.5b")          // tool-capable local model
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Foundry Local model 'qwen2.5-0.5b' not found.");
        if (!await model.IsCachedAsync()) await model.DownloadAsync();
        await model.LoadAsync();
        await manager.StartWebServiceAsync();                            // starts the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint; populates manager.Urls

        // Use the official OpenAI SDK over the BOUND address (manager.Urls is a string[] populated only
        // after startup) - NOT foundryConfig.Web.Urls (the ephemeral input) and NOT IModel.GetChatClientAsync()
        // (which returns a non-Microsoft.Extensions.AI client). .AsIChatClient() comes from Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI.
        var openAi = new OpenAIClient(
            new ApiKeyCredential("not-needed"),                         // Foundry Local needs no key
            new OpenAIClientOptions { Endpoint = new Uri(manager.Urls[0] + "/v1") });
        services.AddChatClient(openAi.GetChatClient(model.Id).AsIChatClient());
        services.AddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("local"));             // record provider for /api/v1/ai/status
}
```

**The bootstrap runs in the API host process** (not the AppHost), where the RID-bound `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` package lives - so it works whether you launch the AppHost or run the API project directly. When Azure is wired, when `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal` is set, or when the bootstrap throws, no live client is registered and `AddAiServices` registers the no-op `IChatClient` (and `AiProviderInfo("none")`), so the app still boots offline.

### Future restored path (after Aspire fix): `RunAsFoundryLocal()`

This is the **preferred/target** local path - restore it once `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry` bundles Foundry Local SDK >= 1.x. Do **not** copy it into a live AppHost before then; it is broken against GA Foundry Local today (see *Known issue*).

```csharp
// AppHost - PREFERRED local path, usable only AFTER the Aspire fix. Broken today (dotnet/aspire#12750).
else if (string.Equals(provider, "FoundryLocal", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
    chat = builder.AddFoundry("foundry").RunAsFoundryLocal()
        .AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.Local.Qwen2505b);       // re-injects ConnectionStrings:chat
}
// ...and the API host returns to: builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat").AddChatClient();
```

### Migration: restoring `RunAsFoundryLocal()`

When `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry` bundles Foundry Local SDK >= 1.x:

1. Remove the API-host workaround refs - `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local`, `OpenAI`, `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI` - and the `RuntimeIdentifiers` added for them.
2. Delete the API-host SDK bootstrap block; the API host returns to host-side `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("chat").AddChatClient()` gated on `ConnectionStrings:chat`.
3. Restore the AppHost `RunAsFoundryLocal()` branch (above) so local mode again wires a `chat` resource via `WithReference(chat)`.
4. Set `foundry.localRuntimeMode: RunAsFoundryLocal` in the resource implementation and drop the SDK-direct host bootstrap, the `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal` guard, and the RID-bound `Test.FoundryLocal` live lane. Keep explicit `AiServices:Provider=FoundryLocal` selection.
5. **After changing the gate, grep the removed tokens across comments and docs, not just code.** A gating-mechanism change (here: SDK-direct -> `RunAsFoundryLocal`, dropping `DisableFoundryLocal`) is done only when the old token is gone from inline comments and XML doc comments too - not just executable logic. `HANDOFF.md` records the high-level change; the recurring miss is a stale doc comment that still names a removed flag and now actively contradicts the logic. This applies to any gating refactor, in either direction.

## Foundry Projects and Server-Hosted Agents

The default agent path is **code-hosted**: a `ChatClientAgent` running in your process over the injected `IChatClient` (above). It works with every Axis-1 lifecycle mode and boots offline as a no-op. Escalate to a **server-hosted** Foundry agent only for hosted memory, centralized/portal-managed tool catalogs, or versioned agent definitions managed outside your code. Server-hosted agents are **Azure-only** - they have no Foundry Local path.

A Foundry **project** is the container that deployments, agents, connections, and tools live under. `RunAsFoundryLocal()` does not support projects or server-hosted agents.

### Aspire-modeled project + prompt agent

`Aspire.Hosting.Foundry` models the project and a declarative **prompt agent**. Tools are project-level resources, reusable across agents. The project reference injects `PROJ_URI` (the project endpoint, `https://<acct>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>`), `PROJ_CONNECTIONSTRING`, and `PROJ_APPLICATIONINSIGHTSCONNECTIONSTRING`.

> **Prompt agents always deploy to Azure Foundry, even under `aspire run`** - local services talk to the cloud-provisioned agent. There is no offline mode. Keep this behind an explicit opt-in so a default run still boots without Azure.

```csharp
// AppHost - opt-in, Azure-only.
var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("proj");
var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt41);

// Tools are project resources (reusable across agents).
var codeInterp = project.AddCodeInterpreterTool("code-interp");
var webSearch = project.AddWebSearchTool("web-search");
// var aiSearch = project.AddAISearchTool("search-tool").WithReference(search);

var agent = project.AddPromptAgent(chat, "assistant-agent",
        instructions: "You are an assistant for {Project}.")
    .WithTool(codeInterp)
    .WithTool(webSearch);

api.WithReference(agent);   // or .WithReference(project) to consume the project endpoint directly
```

### Pre-existing agents via the client SDK

When agents are created in the Foundry portal or by IaC, do not model them in Aspire. Connect to the existing project endpoint (Axis-1 existing mode, or `builder.AddConnectionString(...)`) and drive the agent with the Microsoft Agent Framework Foundry client. Add `Azure.AI.Projects` + `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Foundry` (prerelease) + `Azure.Identity`.

```csharp
using Azure.AI.Projects;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;

var project = new AIProjectClient(new Uri(projectEndpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Code-first responses agent (no server-side agent resource is created):
AIAgent responsesAgent = project.AsAIAgent(
    model: agentModelDeployment, name: "Assistant", instructions: systemPrompt);

// Or bind to a pre-existing versioned agent created in the portal/IaC, by name:
var record = await project.AgentAdministrationClient.GetAgentAsync(agentName);
AIAgent foundryAgent = project.AsAIAgent(record);
```

Both results are standard `AIAgent` instances (sessions, tools, middleware, streaming) - the same surface the code-hosted `ChatClientAgent` exposes, so the application-facing `I{Agent}Agent` contract is unchanged. Use `DefaultAzureCredential` (prefer `ManagedIdentityCredential` in production); the project endpoint comes from `AiServices:FoundryProjectEndpoint` (or the Aspire-injected `PROJ_URI`).

---

## Inference Use-Case Taxonomy

When a slice needs inference, pick the pattern by concept and avoid building several that overlap:

- **Basic completion** - prompt to text via `IChatClient.GetResponseAsync`.
- **Streaming completion** - token UX via `IChatClient.GetStreamingResponseAsync` over Server-Sent Events.
- **Conversational tool-calling agent** - multi-turn `ChatClientAgent` with function tools that delegate to application services.
- **Structured-output decisioning** - prompt for JSON, parse a typed result that drives a deterministic branch (classification/triage).
- **Inline enrichment in a write** - one inference step inside an application command (e.g. draft fields before persisting).
- **Asynchronous event-driven inference** - reason in a background/event handler off a domain event, with the side effect on a different surface.
- **Read-only multi-tool reasoning** - an agent composes read-only tools to recommend, with no persistence.
- **Orchestrated workflow** - a durable workflow engine runs an agent node as one step of a branching, resumable process.

The first three are foundational; the rest embed inference inside application use cases. Start narrow and add a pattern only when the concept is genuinely new.

---

## Testing

Cover the smallest useful surface first:

1. Search service returns expected fields and ordering for the selected search mode.
2. Agent tools call the intended application services and do not bypass business rules.
3. Prompt loading works from file-based system prompts.
4. Disabled AI features do not register or resolve their services.

### Deterministic agents for tests

When the app's primary workflow invokes an AI agent, the primary-journey E2E
([../templates/test-templates-e2e.md](../templates/test-templates-e2e.md) section Primary domain-journey E2E)
must run that agent deterministically and offline - no model call. Gate the live model behind a config
switch so a booted host can swap a scripted agent for the real one. A config switch (not just an injected
fake) is what makes this work where the test cannot reach the host's DI - the Aspire mesh and any
separately-launched host - and it is the simplest path for the journey test.

- Add `{App}:AiServices:UseScriptedAgent` (default false). When true, `AddAiServices` registers a scripted
  `IChatClient`/agent returning canned, deterministic responses (and a fixed tool-call sequence) instead of
  the live or no-op client.
- Set it in the E2E/journey host config (the `SqlApiFactory` config, or the Aspire AppHost testing branch
  alongside `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal=true`) so the journey is repeatable and needs no provider.
- It is a test mechanism, distinct from `AiServices:DevStubContent` (a manual demo aid). Like the stub and
  no-op, the scripted agent reports `isConfigured: false` on `GET /api/v1/ai/status`. Do not enable it in a
  `LiveAI` lane; deterministic booted-host tests assert that state directly. In-process unit/service/endpoint
  tests still inject a fake `IChatClient` directly (see Provider Test Tiers below) - the switch is for the
  booted-host deterministic tiers.

### Provider Test Tiers (Azure / Local / no-op)

Keep the tiers distinct - the model provider must not leak into the fast tiers.

- **Application / service / endpoint tests use a fake `IChatClient`** (a small deterministic stand-in, or a Moq double) - never a real Azure or Foundry Local model. Cover with fakes: the response contract, the parse guard (model JSON wrapped in extra text, or non-parseable output), the no-write path (a triage/draft that must not persist), and the write behavior (a parseable response that does persist). These live in `Test.Unit` / `Test.Endpoints`.
- **Provider selection stays deterministic.** Cover each explicit provider token, `None`, unknown-token failure, and selected-provider missing-config failure with fakes or direct registration tests. Also prove that raw endpoint/deployment/connection settings do not activate a provider while selection is `None`. Live-lane `Assert.Inconclusive` results never substitute for this coverage.
- **Cover the no-op fallback explicitly.** Assert that with no provider wired, `AddAiServices` registers the no-op `IChatClient` (and no-op search/agent) with `AiProviderInfo("none")`, that `GET /api/v1/ai/status` reports `provider: none`, and that each AI endpoint returns its `isConfigured: false` contract without persisting. A no-op path that is never asserted is an untested fallback.
- **Live model tests are smoke only.** The **Azure** live smoke is HTTP-only (no RID) and may run in the mesh tier (`Test.Aspire`). The **Foundry Local** live smoke must run in a dedicated **RID-bound `Test.FoundryLocal`** project, never in the RID-free mesh (see *Deciding the Live Lane* for why). Both assert response contracts (status, `isConfigured: true`, non-empty/typed fields), not exact model text.
- **One active-provider lane, not one lane per provider.** Smoke only the explicitly selected provider. Do not copy every app contract once for Azure and again for Local. The active-provider smoke set is: chat, the tool-calling agent, one safe AI write-adjacent path (e.g. triage with `apply=false`, or a draft that may create), and one FlowEngine agent-workflow run. Reserve an `AzureFoundry` category for genuinely Azure-specific behavior (resource selection / provisioning), never for a second copy of a provider-neutral contract. Add a provider-specific copy only when the behavior actually differs by provider.
- **Do not change deterministic tests from stale IDE evidence.** Before changing fake-client, provider-selection, parse, or persistence assertions, require a fresh CLI reproduction: run the affected project from the current source/build, then repeat the exact failing filter. If the failure does not reproduce, refresh Test Explorer/build artifacts; do not loosen the deterministic contract.

### Optional Live-Provider Classification (canonical owner)

This is the explicit exception to the generic required Docker/AppHost failure rule in [testing.md](testing.md). Keep calls bounded; classification fixes the outcome, not the timeout.

| Checkpoint | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `{APP}_RUN_AZURE_FOUNDRY_TESTS=false` or `{APP}_RUN_FOUNDRY_LOCAL_TESTS=false` | `Assert.Inconclusive` immediately. This is a fast opt-out, not a required flag when an optional provider is absent. |
| Azure was explicitly selected but the shared resolver finds required Azure configuration absent | `Assert.Inconclusive` **before Aspire graph creation** only when this is an optional live lane. Do not boot the graph and infer absence later from status. Required deployment validation fails red. |
| Foundry Local SDK bootstrap reports missing/undiscoverable runtime | `Assert.Inconclusive`; name the missing runtime and unblock step. |
| Foundry Local reports `provider: local`, `isConfigured: true`, but bounded generation exceeds its per-request budget | `Assert.Inconclusive`; keep the bound and report the capacity overrun. Do not increase the timeout as the fix. |
| Provider was eligible/discovered, then AppHost/API/provider startup fails | Fail red with startup/resource diagnostics. |
| Expected provider differs from `/api/v1/ai/status`, or status/routing/HTTP/JSON/schema/contract assertions fail | Fail red. |

Azure live tests perform provider eligibility before Aspire creation: explicit false opt-out first, explicit provider selection plus required-configuration validation second, graph startup third. Foundry Local tests perform explicit false opt-out first, explicit `FoundryLocal` selection second, then SDK bootstrap/runtime classification, API startup, and status. Do not start a graph merely to observe `none`/`stub` when no live provider was selected. After eligibility or runtime discovery, fallback to `none`/`stub` is a configured-provider mismatch and fails.

The live lane must never report green without a real provider. The dev-stub provider remains a manual local/demo aid: if covered, assert deterministically that `stub` maps to `isConfigured: false`; never smoke synthesized content as model output.

Provider dispatch is a closed switch, not an availability fallback chain:

1. `AzureInference` -> validate Azure settings, then use Azure.
2. `OpenAICompatible` -> validate its endpoint/model settings, then use that provider.
3. `FoundryLocal` -> validate the optional native arm, then use Local.
4. `None` -> dev-stub only when explicitly enabled in Development, otherwise no-op.
5. Unknown token -> fail startup with the allowed values.

`Test.Aspire` runs RID-free with `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal=true`; its live AI smoke is Azure-only and checks Azure eligibility before creating the Aspire graph. `Test.FoundryLocal` owns local live proof and is the only tier allowed to load native Foundry Local packages. Both follow the classification table above. Unit/endpoint tests use fake or no-op clients and never native Foundry Local.

### Deciding the Live Lane Without Probing the CLI

Do **not** shell the `foundry` CLI (`foundry service status`, `foundry model info ...`) to decide whether the Local smoke lane runs. The current local path is the self-contained SDK-direct bootstrap (no CLI on `PATH`), and `foundry` catalog/CLI behavior is brittle across versions - a CLI probe can wrongly disable a lane the SDK would have bootstrapped fine.

**The RID constraint decides the lane architecture - it is not a preference.** `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` is a native, RID-forcing package (`RuntimeIdentifiers` + `PrivateAssets="all"`) confined to the API host project. The fast tiers are deliberately **RID-free**: the in-memory `WebApplicationFactory` base (`Test.Support`) loads the API into the RID-free test process, and the Aspire mesh (`Test.Aspire`) is likewise RID-free. They **physically cannot load the local SDK at runtime** - so "request Foundry Local for the test graph" is impossible there, not merely undesirable. Two consequences:

1. **Every API-booting tier that is RID-free must force no-op.** Set `AiServices:DisableFoundryLocal=true` so the API host skips the local attempt and registers the no-op `IChatClient`. Set it on **both** boot paths - the in-memory `WebApplicationFactory` base (`CustomApiFactory` / `SqlApiFactory` config) **and** the Aspire AppHost testing branch (`WithEnvironment("AiServices__DisableFoundryLocal", "true")`). Setting one and missing the other lets that tier silently try to start a model.
2. **The live-local smoke is its own RID-bound project, `Test.FoundryLocal`.** It targets the API host's RIDs, boots the API host directly (not the mesh), and **assumes local** after optional-runtime classification. Missing/undiscoverable runtime is inconclusive; after discovery, provider/startup/status/contract failures are red. Category `[TestCategory("LiveAI")]` (plus `FoundryLocal`). The RID-free mesh handles the **Azure** live smoke (HTTP-only); it never hosts a local model. It must declare its **own** direct `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local` package reference - `PrivateAssets="all"` on the API host stops the native payload flowing transitively (see *Packages* -> *SDK-direct API-host bootstrap*).

**Gate the live lane on `GET /api/v1/ai/status`, not on a connection string.** The endpoint reports the provider resolved from the live object graph - `azure` / `local` / `none` - based on which bootstrap path wired `IChatClient`, recorded once at startup. It must not run a CLI probe or call the model. Do not infer the provider by sniffing a connection string: the SDK-direct local path wires no `chat` connection at all, so a connection-string heuristic reports `none` for a working local model. Scaffold it by default whenever AI is enabled.

**A self-contained provider-proof test owns its graph.** A test that claims to prove a specific provider/config path (local fallback, Azure-only, no-op) constructs its own isolated AppHost graph - as `Test.FoundryLocal` boots the API host directly rather than joining the shared mesh - instead of flipping env vars on a shared graph. AppHost env vars are read at graph-construction time and baked in once the graph starts, so a shared, lazily-started graph cannot re-flip them per test (see [test-templates-aspire.md](../templates/test-templates-aspire.md) section Aspire fixture non-negotiables). External opt-in env vars are fine for selecting which lane runs in CI; they are not a substitute for an isolated graph in a self-contained test.

```csharp
// At bootstrap, whichever path wires IChatClient also records the provider name (no CLI, no
// model call); AddAiServices supplies the dev-stub and "none" fallbacks. See DI Registration + Aspire.
//   Azure host path:   services.AddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("azure"));
//   SDK-direct local:  services.AddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("local"));
//   dev-stub (opt-in):  services.TryAddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("stub"));
//   no provider wired: services.TryAddSingleton(new AiProviderInfo("none"));

// GET /api/v1/ai/status - honest, side-effect-free provider signal for tests and ops.
// isConfigured is provider-derived (a real model only): "stub" and "none" report false, so synthesized
// dev content is never mistaken for a model and a live smoke never reports green on stub or none.
// `group` is the versioned AI route group (/api/v1/ai), so this maps to /api/v1/ai/status - the
// canonical path the CI/live lanes probe. A deployment MAY additionally expose an anonymous,
// unversioned /ai/status alias for infra probes; the versioned path stays canonical.
group.MapGet("/status", (
    [FromServices] AiProviderInfo provider) =>
    Results.Ok(new { provider = provider.Name, isConfigured = provider.Name is "azure" or "local" }))
    .WithName("AiStatus");
```

### Agent Tests

Code-hosted agent tests must control tool use through request/options, not prompt wording. Add request flag such as `UseTools` (default `true`). No-tool smoke sets `UseTools=false` and maps to `ChatOptions.ToolMode = ChatToolMode.None`. Tool-calling tests set `UseTools=true`, use `ChatToolMode.Auto`, and bound the model call itself with a per-request `CancellationTokenSource.CancelAfter(...)` - the MSTest `[Timeout]` is a backstop only, since a local model can otherwise generate until the method timeout fires. Never rely on prompts like "do not call tools" as control flow.

**Bound generation deterministically.** Every structured or demo AI call - agent runs, seeded/demo content, live smokes - sets deterministic `ChatOptions` with at minimum `Temperature = 0` and a small `MaxOutputTokens`, so a local model cannot generate without end; the agent run path shows the concrete shape ([agent-template.md](../templates/agent-template.md)).

```csharp
// ChatClientAgent requires IChatClient - use a mock or test double
// For function tool tests, test tools directly (they're plain C# methods)
var tools = new TaskItemTools(NullLogger<TaskItemTools>.Instance, mockService.Object, mockSearch.Object);
var result = await tools.SearchTasks("overdue");
Assert.IsTrue(result.Contains("expected text"));
```

### Search Tests

Mock `SearchClient` or use an integration test against a real test index. Verify index schema and field names match the projected entity shape.

### Function Tool Tests

Test function tools independently - they are plain C# methods that wrap domain services. Use standard unit test patterns with mocked `I{Entity}Service`.
