# Solution Structure

## Purpose

Define the canonical clean-architecture layout and dependency direction used by all hosts (API, Scheduler, Functions, Gateway, UI) through a shared Bootstrapper.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Use `.slnx` as the solution format (not legacy `.sln`). Place it at **`{SolutionName}.slnx`** in the repo root beside `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `global.json`, and `nuget.config` when that file is generated. Production projects live under `src/`; test projects live under sibling `tests/`.
2. Maintain dependency flow: Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure -> Bootstrapper -> Hosts. **Why:** Reversing the direction couples core policy to adapters, forces adapter dependencies into core tests, and turns provider/host replacement into a cross-layer rewrite. Therefore domain and application projects never reference outward layers.
3. Domain projects never reference Application or Infrastructure.
4. Use central package management via `Directory.Packages.props`.
5. Host projects add host-specific wiring only; shared registrations stay in Bootstrapper.
6. **One public type per file.** Each `.cs` file declares exactly one public/internal top-level type and the file name matches that type. This applies to generated app code (`src/Domain`, `src/Application`, `src/Infrastructure`, `src/Host`, `src/UI`, `tests`) and to local-package source under `src/Packages/<packagePrefix>.*`.

   **What the rule targets:** *unrelated* types sharing a file - `Models.cs` declaring six DTOs, `Constants.cs` holding nested helpers, `ServiceBus.cs` declaring every message type. Lumping like that obscures coupling and impairs navigation. Split it at generation time.

   **What it does not target:** one cohesive family that is read and changed together. Splitting a four-line type into its own file costs more navigation than it saves. The recognized families are:

   - Nested types whose visibility is `private` to the outer type.
   - Compiler-generated partials.
   - An abstract base plus the trivial concrete subclasses that exist only to bind it to a specific dependency.
   - A strongly-typed ID or value family implementing one shared interface, with its factory.
   - An enum or marker plus the single resolver/extension type that exists only to interpret it.
   - Near-identical tooling-only adapters that differ only by type argument (design-time factories, for example).
   - CQRS feature groups: `{Entity}Requests.cs` and `{Entity}Handlers.cs` (see the slice checklist's file map).

   A family qualifies only when every type in the file serves the one named in the file name. When in doubt, split. The Phase 5d lumped-file scan in [../support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](../support/final-scaffold-checklist.md) prints candidates rather than failing, precisely because this call needs judgment: match each hit to a family above or split it.

### Project-Name Prefix (`projectNamePrefix`)

The `{Project}.` / `{Host}.` prefix shown above is the **default** (`projectNamePrefix: solution-name`, set in Phase 1) and matches the TaskFlow reference app. When Phase 1 records `projectNamePrefix: none`, the prefix tokens collapse to empty and the layout uses bare project names, folders, and root namespaces:

```
src/
|-- Domain/
|   |-- Domain.Model/              # was {Project}.Domain.Model
|   `-- Domain.Shared/
|-- Application/
|   |-- Application.Contracts/
|   `-- Application.Services/
|-- Infrastructure/
|   |-- Infrastructure.Data/
|   `-- Infrastructure.Repositories/
|-- Host/
|   |-- Bootstrapper/              # was {Host}.Bootstrapper
|   `-- Api/                       # was {Host}.Api
...
tests/
`-- Test.*                         # test project names are unchanged
{SolutionName}.slnx                # solution file name is NOT collapsed
```

The `{SolutionName}.slnx` file keeps its full name either way, and `{App}`-derived types render without the prefix (`DbContextTrxn` / `DbContextQuery`). `OrganizationName` is not applied under `none`. `tests/`, `src/Packages/`, and `Aspire/` project names already omit the prefix and are unchanged by this setting. Token mechanics: [../ai/placeholder-tokens.md - Derivation Rules](../ai/placeholder-tokens.md#derivation-rules).

> **The prefix is not just verbosity - it prevents framework assembly/namespace collisions.** Bare project names and root namespaces collide with platform identities, and the failures are confusing:
> - A bare **`Uno`** / **`Uno.Core`** project name clashes with the Uno Platform's own `Uno.*` assemblies.
> - A bare **`Application`** layer creates a root `Application` namespace that **shadows `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application`** (and WPF's `System.Windows.Application`) inside any referencing UI project - the XAML code-behind base class fails to resolve (CS0118), and a `global using Application = ...` alias added to "fix" it then collides with the namespace (CS0576).
> - Bare `Domain.Model` / `Application.Services` also collide when consumed alongside other solutions.
>
> Because of this, `projectNamePrefix: none` is an accepted Phase-1 trade-off only for **backend-only** solutions, recorded in `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`. When de-prefixing is requested **and a Uno/Blazor/WPF UI head is in scope**, do one of: (a) keep the prefix on UI heads and the `Application` layer (de-prefix the rest); (b) keep a short qualifier so no project is bare `Uno`/`Uno.Core`/`Application`; or (c) emit fully-qualified base types in generated XAML code-behind (`: global::Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application`). Default to (a). Never ship a bare `Application` namespace into a XAML project.

### Required Root Files (Cross-Platform Hygiene)

The scaffold drops `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, and `.editorconfig` at repo root on first generation.

**`.gitattributes`** - pins working-tree line endings so Windows clients with `core.autocrlf=true` (installer default) don't spam `LF will be replaced by CRLF` warnings on every `git status` and don't block commits under `safecrlf=true`. Minimum content:

```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.ico binary
```

Add at scaffold time - retroactive `.gitattributes` requires `git add --renormalize .` to take effect.

**`.gitignore`** - `dotnet new gitignore` baseline plus Aspire local volumes, Function App secrets, and coverage outputs. **The stock Visual Studio `.gitignore` has two rules that collide with this scaffold's folder names and silently exclude source from `git add` - patch both:**

```gitignore
# `src/Packages/` is a SOURCE folder in this repo (local `<packagePrefix>.*`
# projects), not a NuGet restore folder. The stock `**/[Pp]ackages/*` rule
# matches it case-insensitively on Windows (core.ignoreCase=true is the
# default), so every `<packagePrefix>.*.csproj` under it gets skipped by
# `git add` - local build passes, fresh CI clone fails with MSB3202.
!src/Packages/
!src/Packages/**
src/Packages/**/bin/
src/Packages/**/obj/
```

Also **remove the line `*.e2e`** from the stock template. It targets a legacy Visual Studio trace format this scaffold never produces, but it matches the `tests/Test.E2E/` project directory case-insensitively on Windows and silently excludes the entire E2E test project from git.

**Add ignore patterns for generated test output:** Stryker.NET reports are local quality artifacts and should not be committed. Append:

```gitignore
# Generated test output
**/StrykerOutput/
```

**Add ignore patterns for scaffold-session leakage:** Aspire's local launcher and other tooling occasionally drop transient log files at project root (e.g. `c..tmpaspire-run.log`). These are not scaffold artifacts and should never be committed. Agent and subagent scratch (worktrees, session logs, reports) lives under the repo-root `.tmp/`, and the stock template ignores only `*.tmp` files, not that directory - rules in [../support/multi-agent.md](../support/multi-agent.md) section Agent Scratch. Append:

```gitignore
# Agent scratch: worktrees, session logs, reports
.tmp/

# Scaffold-session leakage (transient logs from local tooling)
/c..tmpaspire-run.log
/*.tmpaspire-run.log
**/aspire-run.log
*.tmp.log
```

Note: `.scaffold/` is a **tracked** directory - it holds the Phase 1/2/3 artifacts (`domain-specification.yaml`, `resource-implementation.yaml`, `UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`, `DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`, `implementation-plan.md`) plus `INSTRUCTION-GAPS.md` and, when the spec opts in, the generated `ontology/` projection. Do not add `.scaffold/` to `.gitignore`.

Failure mode is **invisible locally** (files on disk, build green) and surfaces only on a fresh clone or CI runner. The operator-setup post-generation step runs a `git ls-files` check to catch the same class of bug for any future scaffold folder whose name collides with a stock ignore pattern - see [../support/operator-setup.md](../support/operator-setup.md) section Tracked-Source Validation.

**`.editorconfig`** - pinned tab/space + `end_of_line = lf` (belt-and-suspenders with `.gitattributes`). It must also **make an explicit decision on analyzer diagnostics it cannot fully code-gen away** - a formatting-only editorconfig lets package defaults (MSTest, EF, etc.) leak through at `info` severity, producing silent IDE-only debt that never fails the build. For each such diagnostic, pick one policy and state it intentionally. For `MSTEST0049` (flow the `TestContext` token, generated per the [testing.md](testing.md) Cancellation-Token discipline), the default is **enforce** - it matches the app's zero-warnings expectation and can never silently accumulate:

```editorconfig
# Analyzer severity policy - deliberate, not package-default. Enforce token flow in tests.
[**/*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.MSTEST0049.severity = warning
```

Pair `warning` with `TreatWarningsAsErrors` (opt in via `Directory.Build.props` once the codebase is warning-clean). The acknowledge-and-silence alternative (`severity = none` with a comment saying why) is only for a reference app that deliberately does not want token flow. The anti-pattern is leaving a default-`info` analyzer unaddressed. Both the `TreatWarningsAsErrors` policy and the generation-time gate that verifies no residual analyzer debt are owned by [../support/execution-gates.md](../support/execution-gates.md) (sections Compiler-Warning Policy and Analyzer-Cleanliness Gate).

**Shell redirects:** scaffolded shell-agnostic scripts use `> /dev/null`, never `> NUL`. From git-bash, `> NUL` creates a real on-disk file named `NUL` that Win32 then can't open, breaking `git add -A`. Reserve `> nul` (lowercase) for files that only run under `cmd.exe`.

Note: Domain rules and specifications live in `Domain.Model/Rules/` (or `Domain.Model/Specifications/`). A separate `Domain.Rules` project is not required.

Note: `src/Packages/` exists only when `packageStrategy` is `local` or `hybrid` (set in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`). Generate one packable project per entry in `localPackageLayers`, matching the layer set in [`../support/ef-packages-reference.md`](../support/ef-packages-reference.md). Each project sets `IsPackable=true` and `<PackageId>=<packagePrefix>.<Layer>` so it can later be published to a feed and consumed via `<PackageReference>` without restructuring. When `applicationStyle` is `cqrs` or `switch`, include `<packagePrefix>.CQRS` in this local/feed layer set. When `packageStrategy: feed`, omit the `Packages/` folder entirely - the contracts come from `customNugetFeeds`.

---

## Dependency Direction (Contract)

Required flow:

```
{Prefix}.Common.Contracts / {Prefix}.Domain.Contracts / {Prefix}.Data.Contracts   # local/hybrid only; otherwise NuGet packages
        ^                            ^                          ^
        |                            |                          |
Domain.Shared <- Domain.Model
            \-> Application.Models <- Application.Contracts <- Application.Services
                                  \-> Application.Mappers   /
                                  \-> Application.Cqrs
                                                \-> Application.MessageHandlers
Domain.Model -> Infrastructure.Data -> Infrastructure.Repositories
Application.Contracts -> Infrastructure.Repositories
Application + Infrastructure -> {Host}.Bootstrapper
{Host}.Bootstrapper -> host projects (API/Scheduler/FunctionApp)
```

`src/Packages/<packagePrefix>.*` projects sit at the **bottom** of the dependency graph in `local`/`hybrid` mode - every other layer may depend on them, but they may not depend on any project-specific layer. In `feed` mode, this constraint is enforced by NuGet (packages can't reference local projects).

### Host Rules

- API/Scheduler/FunctionApp reference Bootstrapper and add host-only config.
- Gateway and UI follow their own skills but must not violate core dependency direction.
- Optional hosts should be removable without breaking core layer compilation.
- Uno MVUX presentation records live in `{Host}.Uno.Presentation`, not in the `{Host}.Uno` `Uno.Sdk` app head. `{Host}.Uno.Presentation` and `{Host}.Uno.Core` are plain `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` libraries so `Test.UI` can exercise UI/presentation logic without building platform targets. `{Host}.Uno` references `{Host}.Uno.Presentation`; `Test.UI` references `{Host}.Uno.Core` and `{Host}.Uno.Presentation`.

---

## `.slnx` Requirement

Use XML-based `.slnx` as the final solution artifact.

- Preferred: author `.slnx` directly from the reference pattern.
- If CLI scaffolding creates `.sln`, migrate and remove the `.sln` before continuing.
- Root `.slnx` project paths start with `src/` for production projects and `tests/` for test projects.
- From `tests/Test.*/*.csproj`, production `ProjectReference` paths start with `..\..\src\`; sibling test references such as `..\Test.Support\Test.Support.csproj` stay under `tests/`.

Do not keep both formats in active use.

---

## SDK and Package Management

### `global.json`

- Pin to latest stable installed SDK.
- Keep `rollForward` as `latestFeature`.

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "<latest-installed-stable-sdk>",
    "rollForward": "latestFeature"
  }
}
```

Resolve `<latest-installed-stable-sdk>` from `dotnet --list-sdks` at scaffold time (do not hard-code).

### `Directory.Packages.props`

- `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true`.
- No package versions in project-level `<PackageReference>` entries.
- Update package versions centrally only.

### `.csproj` Conventions

- Target the latest stable TFM supported by the pinned SDK.
- Enable `ImplicitUsings` and `Nullable`.
- API/Gateway use `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`; library projects use `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`.

---

## Infrastructure Naming Rules

- One infrastructure project per external integration.
- Use service-descriptive suffixes (for example: `Infrastructure.Notification`, `Infrastructure.EntraExt`).
- Expose contracts in Application layer; keep implementations in Infrastructure.
- Register each infrastructure module through Bootstrapper extension methods.

### Wrap vs. Direct Reference

Not every external dependency earns an Infrastructure project. Two paths:

- **Wrap (default).** The application layer owns the interface in `Application.Contracts`; the Infrastructure project references `Application.Contracts` and implements it. Services/handlers inject the contract, never the provider type. This is the path for bespoke repositories, Refit API wrappers, and Service Bus / Event Grid adapters. The Infrastructure-references-`Application.Contracts` dependency direction (see the Minimal Reference Matrix) exists precisely so the implementation can satisfy the app-owned interface.
- **Direct reference (exception).** When a library already ships a stable, app-shaped interface, the application layer references that package and injects the interface directly - no `Application.Contracts` interface, no Infrastructure project. FusionCache (`IFusionCache` / `IFusionCacheProvider`) is the canonical case: the cache abstraction is already what you would have written, so wrapping it only re-exports the same shape.

Criterion: wrap when the provider's surface is provider-shaped, transport-coupled, or needs DTO/error mapping (the wrapper rules in [external-api.md](external-api.md)); reference directly when the provider's interface is already the abstraction you would have authored. A direct reference means the `Application` project takes the package reference itself - call that out, it is the deliberate exception to the otherwise internal-only application reference surface (see the Minimal Reference Matrix note).

---

## Minimal Reference Matrix

| Project | Direct References (minimum) |
|---|---|
| `Domain.Shared` | none |
| `Domain.Model` | `Domain.Shared` |
| `Application.Models` | `EF.Common.Contracts` (base DTO contract `IEntityBaseDto`), other shared/common abstractions as needed |
| `Application.Mappers` | `Application.Models`, `Domain.Model`, `Domain.Shared` |
| `Application.Contracts` | `Application.Models`, `Domain.Model`, `Domain.Shared` |
| `Application.Services` | `Application.Contracts`, `Application.Mappers`, `Application.Models`, domain projects, + external packages whose interface is the contract (e.g. FusionCache) |
| `Application.Cqrs` | `Application.Contracts`, `Application.Mappers`, `Application.Models`, domain projects, `<packagePrefix>.CQRS`, + external packages whose interface is the contract (e.g. FusionCache) |
| `Infrastructure.Data` | domain projects |
| `Infrastructure.Repositories` | `Application.Contracts`, `Infrastructure.Data` |
| `{Host}.Bootstrapper` | app/infrastructure implementations |
| `{Host}.Api` / `{Host}.Scheduler` / `{Host}.Functions` | `{Host}.Bootstrapper` (+ host-specific packages) |
| `{Host}.DatabaseMigrator` | `Infrastructure.Data`, `Aspire/ServiceDefaults` (never `{Host}.Bootstrapper` - migrator-local context registrations only) |

Default scaffold and TaskFlow keep `Application.Cqrs` referencing shared `Application.Models` and `Application.Mappers` so service and CQRS styles share one contract. A CQRS-only vertical slice may move feature-specific models, mappers, projections, and adapters under `Application.Cqrs/Features/{Entity}` and then trim unused shared project references.

Adjust optional dependencies per enabled features without inverting layer direction. The `+ external packages whose interface is the contract` clause on the application rows is the deliberate direct-reference exception (see Infrastructure Naming Rules -> Wrap vs. Direct Reference): a library like FusionCache whose own interface is already the abstraction is referenced straight from the application layer, so the application project takes that package reference and no Infrastructure wrapper exists. Wrapped integrations (repositories, Refit APIs, messaging adapters) keep their package references in the Infrastructure implementation project, not in the application layer.

## EF.Packages Source Reference

The private EF.* NuGet packages (`EF.Domain`, `EF.Application`, `EF.Infrastructure`, `EF.Data`, `EF.Utility`, `EF.InternalMessageBus`) have full source available at:

**[https://github.com/efreeman518/EF.Packages](https://github.com/efreeman518/EF.Packages)**

Use this repo as the **authoritative source of truth** for all EF.* types, APIs, and patterns when scaffolding. Key types to understand:

| Type | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EntityBase` | EF.Domain | Base entity with `Id` (init, V7 GUID) and `RowVersion` (nullable byte[]) |
| `AuditableBase<T>` | EF.Domain | EntityBase + audit properties (rarely used when AuditInterceptor is active) |
| `DomainResult<T>` | EF.Domain.Contracts | Railway-oriented domain operation result |
| `Result` / `Result<T>` | EF.Domain.Contracts | Application-layer operation results |
| `RepositoryBase<TCtx,TAudit,TTenant>` | EF.Data | Base repository with CRUD + concurrency |
| `DbContextBase` | EF.Data | Base context - `SaveChangesAsync(ct)` throws `NotImplementedException` by design |
| `IRequestContext` | EF.Utility | Tenant, Roles, CorrelationId, AuditId (NO `.UserId`) |
| `IInternalMessageBus` | EF.InternalMessageBus | Synchronous `Publish()` (NOT async) |
