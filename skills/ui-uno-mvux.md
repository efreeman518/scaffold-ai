## MVUX Model Rules

Use partial records in `src/UI/{Project}.Uno.Presentation/Presentation` with namespace `{Project}.Uno.Presentation.Presentation`:
- Read: `IFeed<T>` / `IListFeed<T>`
- Mutable UI state: `IState<T>` / `IListState<T>`
- Commands: public `ValueTask` methods
- Navigation: `INavigator`
- Cross-model refresh: `IMessenger` + `.Observe(...)`

The `{Project}.Uno.Presentation` project is a plain `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` library that references `{Project}.Uno.Core`, MVUX, navigation, and messenger packages directly. Client wrappers stay in `{Project}.Uno.Core`. Presentation models never live in the `{Project}.Uno` `Uno.Sdk` app head. Keep every MVUX partial record for one app in this one assembly; splitting models across assemblies can make the MVUX generators emit duplicate `BindableXxx` wrappers for shared DTO/state types.

**Platform-coupled service exception.** A model whose injected dependency needs the live Uno.UI rendering assemblies - e.g. the concrete `IThemeService` from `Uno.Toolkit.Skia.WinUI` - cannot compile inside the plain `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` `{Project}.Uno.Presentation` library, because those platform packages are not referenceable there (it fails at build, not review). Preferred fix: inject a portable app-owned abstraction (e.g. `IAppThemeService`) implemented in the `{Project}.Uno` app head, so the model stays in Presentation and unit-testable. Only if no abstraction is feasible, leave that one model in the app head and note why. Never add platform-specific package references to `{Project}.Uno.Presentation`.

Fast MVUX/presentation coverage belongs in `Test.UI` with `UI` / `Presentation` categories. `Test.UI` references `{Project}.Uno.Core` and `{Project}.Uno.Presentation` only; it never references `{Project}.Uno`.

Presentation models use injected dependencies for all shell behavior. Inject `INavigator`, an app-owned theme abstraction (preferred over the concrete `IThemeService` - see the platform-coupled service exception above), `IMessenger`, form guards, and shell action abstractions as needed. Do not call static `App.*` members or static app services from MVUX records; that couples the model to the app head and removes the fast unit-test seam.

### Feed Refresh After Mutations (Version Counter Pattern)

MVUX feeds are pull-based - they do not re-evaluate automatically when the underlying data changes. After a create/update/delete operation, the UI stays stale unless the feed is explicitly invalidated.

**Pattern:** Add an `IState<int>` version counter. Increment it after every mutation. Make the feed depend on the counter so it re-evaluates.

**The dependency trick works for `IState<T>` only.** Reading an `IListState<T>` inside `Feed.Async` is not tracked as a reactive dependency: the feed materializes once (typically empty, because XAML binds at construction before any `LoadAsync` runs) and never updates - silently, with no binding error. Derive from list state via `.AsFeed()` + `Select`, never by awaiting the list state inside `Feed.Async`.

```csharp
public partial record CategoryTreeModel(
    INavigator Navigator,
    ICategoryApiService CategoryService)
{
    // Version counter - increment after any mutation
    public IState<int> CategoriesVersion => State<int>.Value(this, () => 0);

    // Feed depends on version - re-evaluates when version changes
    public IListFeed<CategoryModel> Categories => ListFeed.Async(async ct =>
    {
        _ = await CategoriesVersion;  // creates dependency
        return (await CategoryService.SearchAsync(ct: ct)).ToImmutableList();
    });

    public async ValueTask SaveCategory(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await CategoryService.CreateAsync(/* ... */, ct);
        await CategoriesVersion.Update(v => v + 1, ct);  // triggers feed refresh
    }
}
```

**Rules:**
- One version counter per independent feed (e.g., `CommentsVersion`, `ChecklistVersion`, `AttachmentsVersion` on a detail model).
- `_ = await CategoriesVersion;` inside the feed lambda creates the dependency. Without it, incrementing the counter does nothing.
- Increment the counter as the **last step** of every mutation method (`Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Toggle`).
- For cross-model refresh (e.g., creating a task in `TaskFormModel` should refresh `TaskListModel`), use `IMessenger` with `.Observe(...)` instead of version counters.

### Cross-Model Refresh via Messenger

When a mutation in model A (e.g. Task Save) must refresh model B (e.g. Task List) and B is already constructed on a visible page, `IListFeed` + version counter doesn't help - the receiving model needs a push. Pattern:

1. Define a marker record message: `public sealed record TaskItemsChangedMessage(bool ResetToFirstPage = false);`
2. Receiver registers in its constructor (explicit ctor required - positional-record ctor has no body):
   ```csharp
   Messenger.Register<TaskListModel, TaskItemsChangedMessage>(this, static (recipient, msg) =>
   {
       if (msg.ResetToFirstPage) _ = recipient.LoadPageAsync(1);
       else                      _ = recipient.RefreshAsync();
   });
   ```
3. Sender sends after save: `Messenger.Send(new TaskItemsChangedMessage(ResetToFirstPage: true));`

Non-negotiables:
- Registered with **StrongReferenceMessenger** (see host wiring above) - weak references let records get collected.
- Receive handler is `static` and takes `recipient` - closing over `this` defeats weak-reference safety and produces analyzer warnings.
- Parameter name in the lambda must not be `_` (conflicts with discard in some generator paths). Use `msg` / `message`.
- Process-wide change notifications may refresh shared lists, but editor reset and navigation-scoped messages must carry an entity/model correlation key or unregister with route lifetime. Never broadcast an uncorrelated editor reset through the singleton messenger: stale editor models can receive it and lose unsaved state.

### Buffered Child Items in Create Mode

When a form can add/check child items (checklist, attachments, comments) before the parent entity has been saved, give each buffered item a client-generated `Guid.NewGuid()` Id so the UI can match items by Id immediately. On Save:

1. Bundle the buffered children into the parent DTO (`dto.ChecklistItems`, `dto.Comments`, ...) with `Id = null` on each - the server `Updater` will assign real Ids.
2. Send **one** POST (create) or PUT (update) for the parent + children together. Do NOT loop separate `ChildService.CreateAsync(...)` calls after the parent create - state on the buffered child (e.g. a pre-checked `IsCompleted`) gets silently dropped when the child's domain `Create()` doesn't accept that field. See [updater-template.md](../templates/updater-template.md) -> *createFunc must apply ALL DTO fields*.
3. Client DTO mapper must include the children. Easy miss: `MapToDto` that only copies scalar fields produces a payload the server parses as "no children".
4. Mutations on buffered items (e.g. toggle checked) must only hit the server if the parent is already persisted. Gate with `if (Entity?.Id is not null)` - otherwise the server returns 404 on a non-existent parent and the UI rolls back.

```csharp
// OK Correct - single payload, children embedded
var model = (Entity ?? new TaskItemModel()) with
{
    Title = title,
    /* scalar fields ... */,
    ChecklistItems = isCreate
        ? pendingChecklist.Select(c => c with { Id = null, TaskItemId = Guid.Empty }).ToList()
        : pendingChecklist.ToList(),
    Comments = isCreate
        ? pendingComments.Select(c => c with { Id = null, TaskItemId = Guid.Empty }).ToList()
        : pendingComments.ToList()
};
var saved = isCreate
    ? await TaskItemService.CreateAsync(model, ct)
    : await TaskItemService.UpdateAsync(model, ct);

// FAIL Wrong - post-create loop silently drops child fields that Create() can't take
var saved = await TaskItemService.CreateAsync(model, ct);
foreach (var c in pendingChecklist)
    await ChecklistItemService.CreateAsync(c with { Id = null, TaskItemId = saved.Id!.Value }, ct);
```

```csharp
public async ValueTask ToggleChecklistItem(ChecklistItemModel item, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var updated = item with { IsCompleted = !item.IsCompleted };

    // Update UI state first - this is the source of truth while buffered.
    await ChecklistItems.UpdateAsync((IImmutableList<ChecklistItemModel>? list) =>
    {
        var src = list ?? ImmutableList<ChecklistItemModel>.Empty;
        var idx = FindById(src, item.Id);
        return idx < 0 ? src : src.SetItem(idx, updated);
    }, CancellationToken.None);

    // Only persist if the parent already exists server-side.
    if (Entity?.Id is not null)
    {
        try { await ChecklistItemService.UpdateAsync(updated, ct); }
        catch { /* state rollback not required - buffered flow survives */ }
    }
}
```

### Menu Navigation & Cross-Page Dirty Guard

Persistent menu "always land on the top page" wiring (the three `PanelVisibilityNavigator` traps + proven click handler) and the cross-model form dirty guard moved to a dedicated companion: [ui-uno-navigation.md](ui-uno-navigation.md). Load it when building menu/navigation chrome or a detail page with unsaved-edit protection.

### WASM Console Logging: Use `Console.WriteLine`, Not `Debug.WriteLine`

In Uno WASM, `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine` does NOT reach the browser DevTools console by default - only framework `ILogger` output (prefixed `info:` / `warn:`) is routed there. For ad-hoc diagnostics in code-behind or models, use `Console.WriteLine` - it shows as a plain line in the browser console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"[MainPage] NavigateTopClick tag={tag}");  // OK appears in browser console
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("...");                    // FAIL swallowed in WASM
```

### WASM Rebuild / Hot-Reload Trap

Uno WASM dev hot-reload **does not reliably pick up code-behind changes** (XAML may hot-swap, but `.xaml.cs` edits often serve from the old `package_<hash>/` bundle). Symptoms: console logs from your new code never appear; the UI behaves as before the edit.

Recovery:

1. Stop the running host (`Ctrl+C` on `dotnet run`, or terminate the Aspire resource).
2. `dotnet build src/UI/{Project}.Uno --no-incremental` (forces a clean package hash).
3. In the browser, unregister any service worker (DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers) and hard-refresh (`Ctrl+F5`) - or open the origin in a new tab; never reload an existing tab.

Do not debug perceived "code didn't work" symptoms without verifying the new bundle actually loaded (grep for one of your new `Console.WriteLine` tags in the console).

### URL Sync: Disable AddressBarUpdateEnabled (Chefs Pattern)

The default address-bar update pipeline can lag or lock on a prior route after nested navigation, leaving the browser URL stuck at e.g. `/Main/Categories` while the content has moved on. Match the Chefs reference app by disabling it:

```csharp
.UseNavigation(
    ReactiveViewModelMappings.ViewModelMappings,
    RegisterRoutes,
    configure: navConfig => navConfig with { AddressBarUpdateEnabled = false });
```

The app is still fully navigable via the in-app menu; only the browser URL stops reflecting internal route changes. This is the documented trade-off in Chefs.

### Navigation: Prefer NavigateBackAsync Over Hardcoded Routes

Save/Cancel actions should use `Navigator.NavigateBackAsync(this)` instead of `Navigator.NavigateRouteAsync(this, "Dashboard")`. Hardcoded route names break when the user arrives from a different page (e.g., navigating to TaskForm from TaskList vs Dashboard).

```csharp
// OK Correct - returns to wherever the user came from
await Navigator.NavigateBackAsync(this, cancellation: ct);

// FAIL Wrong - always goes to Dashboard even if user came from TaskList
await Navigator.NavigateRouteAsync(this, "Dashboard", cancellation: ct);
```

### ListView Item Click Navigation

To make ListView items navigable (e.g., clicking a task row opens its detail page), wrap the item template content in a `Button` with `uen:Navigation.Request` and `uen:Navigation.Data`:

```xml
<ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Data.RecentActivity}" SelectionMode="None">
    <ListView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <Button uen:Navigation.Request="{Entity}Item"
                    uen:Navigation.Data="{Binding}"
                    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"
                    HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch"
                    Background="Transparent"
                    BorderThickness="0"
                    Padding="0" Margin="0,3">
                <!-- Item visual content here -->
            </Button>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>
```

**Why:** `Button` supplies the activation, keyboard, focus, and automation behavior a navigable row needs; navigation properties on a plain `Border` do not create an equivalent interactive surface. Do not nest action buttons inside the row button - use a non-navigating container with explicit buttons when a row has independent actions.

**Do not** rely on `ListView.SelectionChanged` or `ItemClick` for navigation - these are less reliable with MVUX data binding than the declarative `uen:Navigation.Request` approach.

### MVUX Pitfalls

- **One button's `Command` silently no-ops while others work**: MVUX generates the command under the **bare method name** - `SelectSpread()` becomes `SelectSpread`, not `SelectSpreadCommand`. Binding `{x:Bind ViewModel.SelectSpreadCommand}` matches nothing with zero diagnostics. Drop the `Async` suffix on command methods too, so the generated name is unambiguous.
- **Every `Button.Command` silently no-ops (feeds bind, lists render, commands do nothing)**: the first argument to `UseNavigation(...)` in the host config is missing `ReactiveViewModelMappings.ViewModelMappings`. Without it, navigation sets each page's `DataContext` to the **raw MVUX record** - feed properties are real and bind fine, but command methods are only surfaced as `ICommand` on the generated `Bindable{Model}`, so `{x:Bind ViewModel.Command}` resolves against the wrong object and does nothing. There is no exception; the only console signal is `The [{CommandName}] property getter does not exist on type [...Model]`. Fix: `.UseNavigation(ReactiveViewModelMappings.ViewModelMappings, RegisterRoutes, configure: ...)` (see [ui-uno-shell.md](ui-uno-shell.md) host-config block).
- **`Feed.Async` type inference**: `Feed.Async(service.GetAsync)` may fail with CS0411/CS0453 when the return type is a reference type or the delegate signature is ambiguous. Always use an explicit lambda: `Feed.Async(async ct => await service.GetAsync(ct))`.
- **`IListFeed` return type**: `ListFeed.Async(...)` callbacks must return `IImmutableList<T>`. Call `.ToImmutableList()` on results. Requires `using System.Collections.Immutable;` (add as global using in csproj, see Project File Rules).
- **Nullable state**: `IState<T?>` with `State.UpdateAsync` can produce CS8620/CS8621/CS8714 warnings. Prefer private nullable backing state when practical. In tests, suppress these warnings only around the awaiter/assertion seam; do not add broad production suppressions unless there is no cleaner model shape.
- **No optional parameters on command methods**: The MVUX Bindable generator emits a compile error like `CS0103: The name 'False' does not exist` when a command method has an optional parameter (e.g. `public ValueTask Refresh(bool hard = false, CancellationToken ct = default)`). Split into two methods (`Refresh(ct)` + `RefreshHard(ct)`) or take the parameter as state instead. CancellationToken default is fine.
- **`IListState<T>.UpdateAsync` overload ambiguity**: There are two overloads - one updates a single item, one updates the whole list. When you pass a bare lambda the compiler picks the single-item one and you get `'IImmutableList<T>' does not contain 'FindIndex'` or `Operator '??' cannot be applied...`. Explicitly type the parameter to disambiguate:
  ```csharp
  await Items.UpdateAsync((IImmutableList<ChildModel>? list) =>
  {
      var src = list ?? ImmutableList<ChildModel>.Empty;
      var idx = /* find */;
      return idx < 0 ? src : src.SetItem(idx, updated);
  }, CancellationToken.None);
  ```
- **Don't cancel state writes with the command's CT**: MVUX commands flip `IsEnabled` bindings during execution, which can cascade back and cancel the command's own `CancellationToken` mid-state-update, leaving state half-written. For `UpdateAsync` calls that must complete, pass `CancellationToken.None`. Only use the command CT on the outbound HTTP / service call.
- **Command-CT cancels mid-HTTP**: Same mechanism cancels the HTTP call to the server. If a state update during the request flips an IsEnabled binding, the command CT is cancelled and the fetch aborts. For navigation-triggering commands (Save/Update), pass `CancellationToken.None` to the service call too.
- **Prefer individual `IState<T>` fields over a wrapped result object**: Binding a XAML pager/grid to `Data.PageNumber`, `Data.HasNextPage`, etc. via a single `IState<PageResult>` breaks: the generated bindable surfaces `Data` as a snapshot and child paths don't re-evaluate on partial updates. Declare one `IState<int> PageNumber`, `IState<bool> HasNextPage`, `IListState<T> Items`, etc. and update each explicitly in the load method.

Example pattern:

```csharp
namespace {Project}.Uno.Presentation.Presentation;

public partial record TodoItemListModel(
    INavigator Navigator,
    ITodoItemService Service,
    IMessenger Messenger)
{
    public IListFeed<TodoItemModel> Items => ListFeed.Async(Service.GetAll);

    public IState<string> SearchTerm => State<string>.Value(this, () => string.Empty);

    public IListState<TodoItemModel> FilteredItems => ListState
        .FromFeed(this, Feed.Combine(SearchTerm, Items.AsFeed())
            .SelectAsync(Filter)
            .AsListFeed())
        .Observe(Messenger, x => x.Id);

    public ValueTask OpenDetail(TodoItemModel item, CancellationToken ct) =>
        Navigator.NavigateRouteAsync(this, "TodoItemDetail", data: item, cancellation: ct);
}
```

## Routing + Mapping

- Define `ViewMap`/`DataViewMap` in one route registration method.
- Keep route names stable (`Home`, `{Entity}List`, `{Entity}Item`, `Settings`).
- **One route per entity** for add/edit: `{Entity}Item` receives optional entity data (null = create, non-null = edit).
- Pass selected entity as route data for the entity page.

### Route Architecture (Shell vs MainPage)

Shell and MainPage serve **distinct roles** in the navigation hierarchy. Mixing them breaks the navigation bootstrap.

| Layer | View | Contains | Route binding |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|
| Root | `Shell` | `ExtendedSplashScreen` + `Frame` only | Viewless `ShellModel` at root `""` |
| Chrome | `MainPage` | Header bar, sidebar/bottom `TabBar`, content `Frame` or region | `ViewMap<MainPage, MainModel>` nested under root, `IsDefault: true` |
| Content | Page views | Page-specific UI | Nested under `Main` route |

**Critical**: Shell must NOT contain app chrome (headers, tabs, navigation bars). The `ExtendedSplashScreen` manages the navigation bootstrap chain - placing chrome in Shell means it either gets covered by the splash screen or, when the splash is removed, the navigation Frame stops receiving page content.

**Why chrome cannot live inside `Splash.Content`**: Uno's navigation bootstrap replaces the entire `ExtendedSplashScreen.Content` subtree with a `FrameView` at runtime once the host finishes loading. Any Grid/Border/StackPanel you author inside `Splash.Content` is thrown away - observable symptom is a header or nav bar that renders before the splash clears and then vanishes. All persistent chrome belongs in **MainPage**, never in Shell.

### Route Registration Pattern (Chefs-Aligned)

```csharp
private static void RegisterRoutes(IViewRegistry views, IRouteRegistry routes)
{
    // App.xaml.host.cs in the Uno app head imports {Project}.Uno.Presentation.Presentation.
    views.Register(
        // Viewless root - Shell resolves via NavigateAsync<Shell>()
        new ViewMap(ViewModel: typeof(ShellModel)),
        // MainPage is the app chrome shell (header, tabs, content frame)
        new ViewMap<MainPage, MainModel>(),
        new ViewMap<DashboardPage, DashboardModel>(),
        new ViewMap<{Entity}ListPage, {Entity}ListModel>(),
        // Single entity page - Entity? data: null=create, non-null=edit
        new ViewMap<{Entity}Page, {Entity}PageModel>(Data: new DataMap<{Entity}Model>()),
        new ViewMap<SettingsPage, SettingsModel>()
    );

    routes.Register(
        new RouteMap("", View: views.FindByViewModel<ShellModel>(),
            Nested:
            [
                new RouteMap("Main", View: views.FindByViewModel<MainModel>(), IsDefault: true,
                    Nested:
                    [
                        new RouteMap("Dashboard", View: views.FindByViewModel<DashboardModel>(), IsDefault: true),
                        new RouteMap("{Entity}List", View: views.FindByViewModel<{Entity}ListModel>()),
                        new RouteMap("{Entity}Item", View: views.FindByViewModel<{Entity}PageModel>()),
                    ]
                ),
                // Routes outside Main (no tab bar chrome)
                new RouteMap("Settings", View: views.FindByViewModel<SettingsModel>()),
            ]
        )
    );
}
```

> **Naming collision avoidance**: If the entity model is `{Entity}Model` (e.g., `TaskItemModel`) and the presentation model would also be `{Entity}Model`, append `PageModel` to the presentation class (e.g., `TaskItemPageModel`). Use the full namespace qualifier in `ViewMap`/`RouteMap` if needed.

### Route Non-Negotiables

1. **Root ViewMap is viewless**: `new ViewMap(ViewModel: typeof(ShellModel))` - no `<TView>` type parameter. Shell is resolved by `NavigateAsync<Shell>()`, not by the route map.
2. **MainPage is a nested route with `IsDefault: true`**: The navigation system navigates Shell -> Main -> Dashboard. Without the `Main` intermediate route, page content renders directly in Shell's Frame with no chrome.
3. **Tab routes nest under Main**: Dashboard, entity lists, and other tab-navigable pages must be children of the `Main` route so they render inside MainPage's content region (which has `uen:Region.Attached="True"`).
4. **Chrome-free routes nest under root**: Settings, login, profile - routes that should NOT show the tab bar - go as siblings of `Main`, not children of it.

## XAML Rules

- Code-behind stays minimal (initialize + thin UI-only behaviors).
- Put visual tokens and style overrides in `Styles/` dictionaries.
- Use converters from `Converters/` for presentation-only formatting.
- Keep reusable UI in `Views/Controls` and shared templates in `Views/Templates`.
- Give meaningful images an accessible name. Mark purely decorative brand/art images as decorative with the platform-supported accessibility setting so screen readers do not announce filenames or duplicate nearby text; verify the effective accessibility tree on each enabled renderer.

### XAML Pitfalls

- **`TreeViewItemTemplateSelector`** does not exist. Use `<DataTemplate>` directly inside `<TreeView.ItemTemplate>`.
- **`uen:NavigationBar`** (`Uno.Extensions.Navigation.UI.NavigationBar`) does not exist. For top bars use `utu:NavigationBar` from `Uno.Toolkit.UI`, or omit and rely on `NavigationView` header.
- **`uen:ContentControl`** doesn't exist. For navigation content regions, use `<Frame />` inside a `<Grid uen:Region.Attached="true">`.
- **`NavigationView` content area**: Place a `<Grid uen:Region.Attached="true"><Frame /></Grid>` as the `NavigationView` content for region-based navigation.
- **`utu:AutoLayout.PrimaryAlignment`** valid values are `Stretch`, `Center`, `End` - there is no `Start`. Using `Start` produces a XAML parse error with no useful message. Default to `Stretch` for full-width content.
- **Unresolved bindings reset the target to the DP's type default, converter unrun.** When a `DataContext` goes null (e.g. a tab with no model yet), a bound `Visibility` falls back to its type default `Visible` - a loading overlay renders permanently and blocks input. Every visibility/gating binding that can lose its `DataContext` carries `FallbackValue=Collapsed`.

### Responsive Menu Pattern (Side-Nav Wide / Bottom-Tabs Narrow)

Use `utu:Responsive` with `Normal` (mobile/narrow) and `Wide` (desktop) breakpoints to toggle visibility of two parallel menu trees inside MainPage. Keep a single content region between them.

```xml
<!-- Desktop side nav -->
<Border Grid.Column="0"
        Visibility="{utu:Responsive Normal=Collapsed, Wide=Visible}"
        Width="160">
    <StackPanel Orientation="Vertical" ...>
        <Button Click="NavigateTopClick" Tag="Dashboard" .../>
        <!-- ... -->
    </StackPanel>
</Border>

<!-- Mobile bottom tab bar -->
<Grid Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1"
      Visibility="{utu:Responsive Normal=Visible, Wide=Collapsed}">
    <!-- 4 Column buttons, all with Click="NavigateTopClick" -->
</Grid>
```

Both menus call the same `NavigateTopClick` code-behind handler (see [ui-uno-navigation.md](ui-uno-navigation.md) section Menu Navigation: Always Land On Top Page). Do not try to use a single `utu:TabBar` for both layouts - its `OnClickBehaviors` default to stack-aware navigation, which conflicts with the "always-to-top" requirement.

### Grid Paging - Fixed Header & Pager, Scrollable Body

When a list spans more rows than the viewport, the header and pager must stay visible while only the rows scroll. Use a three-row `Grid` with `Auto / * / Auto` and put the `ScrollViewer` around only the items region. Do NOT put the outer page content inside a `ScrollViewer` - the inner list will never get a scrollbar because the outer one absorbs all the height.

```xml
<Grid RowDefinitions="Auto,*,Auto">
    <!-- Row 0: toolbar / filters -->
    <Border Grid.Row="0" .../>

    <!-- Row 1: scrollable list body -->
    <ScrollViewer Grid.Row="1" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto">
        <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding Items}" .../>
    </ScrollViewer>

    <!-- Row 2: pager (First / Prev / pages / Next / Last) -->
    <Border Grid.Row="2" .../>
</Grid>
```

### ItemsControl vs FeedView for Child Collections

For **independently-editable in-page child lists** (checklist items, attachments, buffered-before-save child rows), bind `ItemsControl.ItemsSource` directly to an `IListState<T>` and skip `uer:FeedView`. `FeedView` adds a ValueTemplate/ProgressTemplate wrapper that sizes to content-undefined during initial empty state, giving you a tall empty region, and the progress/value template swap can suppress the `ItemsSource` change notification that toggles a `CheckBox` visually.

Use `FeedView` for top-level page data that has distinct None/Error/Progress UX. Use bare `ItemsControl` for inline children whose UI just needs to track a list state.

`FeedView.ErrorTemplate` receives the exception itself as its data context. Bind the message directly (`{Binding Message}`) or use a converter over the exception. `{Binding Error}` and nested paths such as `{Binding Error.Message}` render blank because there is no wrapper object at that boundary. Add one presentation/render test that supplies a known exception and asserts visible error text.

## Business Service Rules

In `Business/Services`:
- Define `I{Feature}Service` interfaces.
- Implement via Kiota client wrapper.
- Convert transport DTOs to UI models at service boundary.
- Surface `Result`/failure states usable by MVUX models.

### Client-API Contract Rules

The wire contract - `DefaultRequest<T>` / `DefaultResponse<T>` envelopes, the unwrapped `SearchRequest<TFilter>` / `PagedResponse<T>` search shape, the shared `EF.Common.Contracts` types, and the empirically-verified page-index base - is owned by [api.md](api.md) -> *Request / Response Envelope Contract*. The Kiota client stub (or hand-written `{Project}ApiClient`) binds to it as written; pair with the round-trip test in [testing-quality.md](testing-quality.md).

#### Trimmed browser-WASM JSON contract

Published trimmed browser-WASM builds cannot depend on reflection-based `System.Text.Json` metadata. The Uno client owns an internal source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` and lists every concrete wire type used by HTTP calls: request DTOs, `DefaultRequest<T>`, `DefaultResponse<T>`, `PagedResponse<T>`, collections, and any internal callback/envelope deserialized inside a method body. Public method return types alone are not a complete inventory.

Wire every JSON call explicitly through generated metadata: use the `PostAsJsonAsync` / `PutAsJsonAsync` / `ReadFromJsonAsync` overload that accepts `JsonTypeInfo<T>`, or use one shared `JsonSerializerOptions` whose `TypeInfoResolver` is the generated context. Do not mix source-generated writes with reflection-based reads. A Release/trimming contract test must disable reflection, execute one request and response sample for every registered concrete type, and fail when a client method introduces an unregistered internal envelope.

#### Pagination contract

Envelope types, the `EF.Common.Contracts` reuse rule, the empirically-verified page-index base, and
the drift symptoms live in [api.md](api.md) -> *Request / Response Envelope Contract*. Bind the Uno
client to those types directly; do not re-derive `SearchRequest` / `PagedResponse` in the UI project,
and do no offset conversion in the response parser.

## Auth Rules

- UI authenticates to Gateway identity provider.
- No direct API tokens in XAML or page code-behind.
- Keep auth/session handling in host/services.

### Dev-Mode Auth to Production MSAL Upgrade

Scaffold with `.AddCustom()` (no external identity provider required). When ready for production:

1. Complete the admin/interactive-client registration runbook in [identity-management.md](identity-management.md), including redirect URIs, roles, admin consent, and a local CIAM acceptance user
2. Update `appsettings.json` `EntraExternal` section with real tenant values
3. Replace `.AddCustom(...)` with `.AddMsal()` in `App.xaml.host.cs`
4. Change `<UnoFeatures>` in `.csproj`: `AuthenticationCustom` to `AuthenticationMsal`
5. `AuthTokenHandler` (reads `ITokenCache`) works identically with both providers
6. Configure Gateway with its Entra External ID section (see [identity-management.md](identity-management.md))

The login model first reads anonymous `GET /auth/mode` from the auth-owning host. Show the development email form only for `Scaffold`/`Local`; show the Entra interactive action only for `Entra`. A build/runtime mismatch is a configuration error, not permission to fall back to local login.

### Browser-WASM MSAL Custom Web UI

Uno's Skia runtime flavor can serve a browserwasm target while `WithUnoHelpers()` still selects desktop OS-browser behavior. In the browser sandbox that path can throw `PlatformNotSupportedException` surfaced as a generic `Browser` failure.

For every MSAL-enabled `#if __WASM__` target, ship all three browser-specific pieces:

1. **`WasmPopupWebUi.cs`:** implement `ICustomWebUi`, use `globalThis.open` to synchronously pre-open a blank popup from the user's click, then navigate that retained handle to the authorize URL after async discovery. A popup first opened after an `await` loses the browser user gesture and may be blocked. Do not add `noopener` / `noreferrer` when the implementation requires the returned window handle; those features can make `window.open()` return `null` even when a window opened. Pass the completed callback URL to MSAL. Do not fall back to desktop `WithUnoHelpers()` inside browserwasm.
2. **`login-callback.htm`:** publish a same-origin callback page. CIAM can send `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` headers that permanently sever `window.opener` and the app's popup reference, so polling `popup.location` never observes the final redirect. The callback page writes its `location.href` to a per-attempt `localStorage` key; the app polls that key from its own origin.
3. **`EntraAuthService.cs`:** configure interactive acquisition with the custom UI and supply `.WithHttpClientFactory(...)` an `IMsalHttpClientFactory` that returns a plain browser-safe `HttpClient`. Do not configure `HttpClientHandler` proxy, certificate, decompression, or other unsupported knobs; browser-WASM uses the fetch-backed handler and MSAL's default handler configuration can throw `PlatformNotSupportedException`.

The return channel is one-time state, not token storage. Require non-empty OIDC state, correlate the key to the current auth attempt, clear it before opening and immediately after success/failure, validate the callback origin/path and correlation value before returning it to MSAL, never store access/refresh tokens, and keep popup/poll cancellation bounded. Browser storage APIs can throw on managed devices or privacy-restricted profiles; catch that boundary and surface a recoverable "browser storage unavailable" sign-in error instead of hanging, crashing, or silently weakening correlation. Fail clearly on popup blocking, timeout, malformed callback, or unexpected origin.

Automated auth bypass and local-session `WasmUI` tests do not execute these pieces. Before deployment, complete one real interactive sign-in per enabled UI head from its published `Release` build, including browserwasm, and verify the resulting token reaches the Gateway. Debug-only proof is insufficient because browser-WASM timing and trimming differ in Release.

### Android MSAL Interactive Sign-In

`WithUnoHelpers()` wires only the parent activity - on Android, interactive sign-in never completes without two additional pieces:

- `MainActivity.OnActivityResult` forwards the result: `AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationContinuationEventArgs(requestCode, resultCode, data)`.
- The `BrowserTabActivity` intent filter for `msal{clientId}://auth` in the Android manifest, so the system browser/custom tab can return.

The custom-tab return can still be canceled (user swipe, OEM browser quirks) before MSAL receives its redirect; configure `WithUseEmbeddedWebView(true)` as the in-app fallback path. Trimmed Release builds additionally need `Uno.UI.MSAL` in the trim roots - see [ui-uno-platforms.md](ui-uno-platforms.md) section Android Release Trimming.
