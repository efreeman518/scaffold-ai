# Domain Specification Schema (Phase 1 Output)

Pure business domain model - no implementation details, no datatypes, no databases.

**JSON Schema:** [`schemas/domain-specification.schema.json`](../schemas/domain-specification.schema.json) - use for programmatic validation of `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml`.

## Output Contract

Write Phase 1 output to `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` in the target project (create the `.scaffold/` directory at project root if absent). Do not write project artifacts under `.instructions/`; that directory is the installed runtime instruction payload.

Phase 1 also writes:

- `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` - shared domain vocabulary for future AI/developer sessions.
- `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` - decision log and dependency graph for design choices.
- `.scaffold/ontology/` - only when the spec declares `ontology:`; a generated projection of this YAML (regenerate, never edit). Command and outputs: [../support/ontology-projection.md](../support/ontology-projection.md) section Generate.

Run the shared understanding interview before finalizing this YAML. See [shared-understanding-interview.md](shared-understanding-interview.md).

## Project Identity

```yaml
ProjectName: ""
ProjectDescription: ""
OrganizationName: ""               # optional namespace prefix (host/UI projects only)
projectNamePrefix: solution-name   # solution-name (default) | none
```

`projectNamePrefix` controls whether generated project names, folders, and root namespaces carry the solution-name prefix. Confirm it with the developer in Phase 1 (see [shared-understanding-interview.md - Project Naming Decision](shared-understanding-interview.md#project-naming-decision)).

- `solution-name` (default) - matches the TaskFlow reference app: `{Project}.Domain.Model`, `{Host}.Api`, `{App}DbContextTrxn`.
- `none` - bare project names and namespaces: `Domain.Model`, `Api`, `DbContextTrxn`; `OrganizationName` is not applied.

Either way the solution file is named `{SolutionName}.slnx`. Token mechanics: [placeholder-tokens.md - Derivation Rules](placeholder-tokens.md#derivation-rules).

## Entities

Define what the business calls things, their lifecycle, and how they relate.

> **WARNING Naming Conflicts:** Avoid entity names that collide with C# framework types. Common conflicts:
> - `Task` -> conflicts with `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` - use `WorkItem`, `ProjectTask`, or `JobTask`
> - `Thread` -> conflicts with `System.Threading.Thread` - use `Discussion`, `Conversation`
> - `Timer` -> conflicts with `System.Threading.Timer` - use `Reminder`, `Schedule`
> - `Type` -> conflicts with `System.Type` - use `Category`, `Classification`
> - `String`, `Object`, `Action`, `Attribute`, `File`, `Path` -> all conflict with System types
>
> These collisions cause subtle compilation errors or require `global::` disambiguations throughout the codebase.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: TodoItem
    description: "A unit of work assigned to a team member"
    isTenantEntity: true
    properties:
      - { name: Title, required: true, description: "Short summary" }
      - { name: Description, required: false }
      - { name: DueDate, required: false }
      - { name: Priority, kind: enum, values: [Low, Medium, High, Critical] }
      - { name: Status, kind: flags_enum, values: [None, IsStarted, IsCompleted] }
    children:
      - { name: Comments, entity: Comment, relationship: one-to-many, cascadeDelete: true }
      - { name: Tags, entity: Tag, relationship: many-to-many }
    navigation:
      - { name: Category, entity: Category, required: false }
      - { name: AssignedTo, entity: TeamMember, required: false }
```

### Property Rules

- `kind`: `string` (default) | `enum` | `flags_enum` | `number` | `date` | `boolean` | `identifier` | `money` | `text` | `value_object`
- No `type`, `maxLength`, `precision` here - those are Phase 2 concerns
- `required`: business requirement, not database nullability
- `sensitive: true`: property holds PII / secret / regulated data (SSN, national id, tokens, health data). Absence = not sensitive; do not over-apply. A `sensitive` property raises a Security-branch Always Encrypted decision in Phase 1 (see [shared-understanding-interview.md](shared-understanding-interview.md) section Sensitive-Data Trigger). Mechanics: [../support/data-persistence-advanced.md](../support/data-persistence-advanced.md) section Always Encrypted.
- For `kind: value_object`, set `valueObject: {ValueObjectName}` and define it under top-level `valueObjects`
- For operational reason fields (`ReasonCode` style), prefer:
  - fixed, stable set -> `enum`
  - evolving/managed set -> dedicated catalog entity (for localization/versioning)

## Value Objects

Use `valueObjects` for concepts where a primitive would hide business meaning, validation, behavior, or equality. Do not wrap every string or number by default. Good candidates: money, date range, call window, email address, phone number, percentage, or values easy to confuse with the same primitive.

Value objects are domain-side types. DTO/API contracts stay primitive/Guid-friendly by default; mappers flatten fields into DTOs and create value objects through domain factories.

```yaml
valueObjects:
 - name: DateRange
   description: Start and optional end date for scheduled work
   fields:
    - { name: StartDate, kind: date, required: true }
    - { name: EndDate, kind: date, required: false }
   rules:
    - name: EndAfterStart
      condition: EndDate absent or after StartDate
   usedBy:
    - { entity: Project, property: Schedule }

entities:
 - name: Project
   properties:
    - { name: Schedule, kind: value_object, valueObject: DateRange, required: false }
```

### Modeling a Named-Value / Status / Classification Field

When a field holds one of several named values, a status, or a classification, pick the model before writing the spec. Default to the simplest row that fits.

| Model | Choose when | Wrong-choice smell |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| `enum` | Fixed closed set; values are interchangeable labels; no transition rules; no per-value structure | A `switch` on the enum keeps growing; some values are only valid after others |
| `flags_enum` | Same as enum, but several values can be true at once (combinable states/features) | Modeling combinations as extra enum members (`ReadAndWrite`) |
| `stateMachine` | Values have allowed transitions, guards, or trigger events (a lifecycle/status) | Transition checks scattered in service code; invalid status jumps slip through |
| Separate entities | Different values carry different properties, relationships, lifecycles, or rules | Nullable columns that only apply to one `Type`; `if (Type == X)` branching everywhere |
| Catalog / reference entity | The set evolves at runtime or needs localization, versioning, or admin management | Shipping code to add a value; translators editing an enum |
| Value object | The field carries behavior and equality over data, not a label (money, date range, address) | Primitive obsession; equality/validation logic copied at each use site |

Enums are appropriate for a **fixed, closed set of named values** with no transition logic. Two misuses to avoid:

**1. Do not use an enum in place of a state machine.**
If the values have allowed transitions, guards, or trigger events, model it as a `stateMachine` (see State Machines section). An enum with transition logic buried in service code is a state machine in disguise - it will accumulate `switch` statements and invariant violations across the codebase.

Wrong: `Status: enum [Draft, Active, Suspended, Closed]` when only certain transitions are valid.
Right: declare a `stateMachine` with explicit `states`, `transitions`, and guards.

**2. Do not collapse multiple domain entities into one entity by misusing an enum discriminator.**
If objects with different `Type` values have different properties, relationships, lifecycles, or rules, they are separate entities - not one entity with a `Kind`/`Type` enum. Collapsing them produces nullable columns, conditional logic everywhere, and violated invariants.

Wrong: a single `Notification` entity with `Type: enum [Email, SMS, Push]` where each type has different required fields and delivery rules.
Right: a shared `Notification` base entity (or interface) with separate `EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`, `PushNotification` entities.

Apply enum freely when the values are genuinely interchangeable labels with no structural or behavioral difference between them.

### Relationship Types

- `one-to-many` - parent owns children. Specify cascade behavior.
  ```yaml
  children:
    - { name: Comments, entity: Comment, relationship: one-to-many, cascadeDelete: true }
  ```
- `one-to-one` - parent owns exactly one child (1:1 ownership). Materializes as a unique FK on the child, a single (non-collection) navigation on the parent, and cascade delete. Prefer this over `one-to-many` plus an "at most one" entity rule.
  ```yaml
  children:
    - { name: Detail, entity: TodoItemDetail, relationship: one-to-one, cascadeDelete: true }
  ```
- `many-to-many` - peer association. Join entity details are Phase 2.
  ```yaml
  children:
    - { name: Tags, entity: Tag, relationship: many-to-many }
  ```
- `self-referencing` - hierarchical structures within the same entity.
  ```yaml
  children:
    - { name: Children, entity: TodoItem, relationship: self-referencing, selfReferenceKey: ParentId }
  ```
- `polymorphic-join` - shared attachment pattern across parent types.
  ```yaml
  children:
    - { name: Attachments, entity: Attachment, relationship: polymorphic-join, polymorphicEntityTypes: [TodoItem, Comment] }
  ```
- Reference navigation (no ownership):
  ```yaml
  navigation:
    - { name: Category, entity: Category, required: false }
  ```

### Aggregate Roots vs Owned Children (drives the generated write surface)

The `children` / `navigation` structure already encodes aggregate ownership; this section makes it **normative for generation** so downstream phases apply the DDD default (GR-15) instead of treating every entity as an independent root.

**Default classification (derive it, do not ask):**

- An entity that appears as the `entity` target of another entity's `one-to-many` or `one-to-one` `children` relationship is an **owned child** of that aggregate (e.g. `Comment`, `ChecklistItem` owned by a task). It has no identity or lifecycle outside its parent.
- A `many-to-many` relationship produces a **junction** that is an owned child (membership) of the declaring root; the **associated** entity (e.g. `Tag`) remains an independent **root**.
- A `self-referencing` relationship keeps the entity a **root** (it owns a tree of itself).
- A `polymorphic-join` child (e.g. `Attachment`) is its **own root** with a polymorphic owner reference - not an owned child.
- Every entity not owned by any parent is an **aggregate root**.

**Explicit override (only when the default is wrong):** add `aggregateRole` to an entity to pin the classification - `root`, `owned-child` (name the `aggregateParent`), or `join`. Use it for a shared child owned by more than one parent, or a child that genuinely has an independent lifecycle.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: Comment
    aggregateRole: owned-child       # no standalone write slice; mutated through TaskItem
    aggregateParent: TaskItem
  - name: Tag
    aggregateRole: root              # independent aggregate; full slice
```

**Generation consequence (GR-15, default-on - opt out only on explicit instruction):** an **owned child** gets entity + EF config + DbSet + the root's `Add*`/`Remove*` methods + `{Root}Updater` wiring + DTO + mapper + optional read query (`Get`/`Search`). It gets **no** standalone create/update/delete command, handler, service write method, or write endpoint - those become nested sub-resource routes on the root (see [../skills/domain-model.md](../skills/domain-model.md) section Aggregate Roots vs Internal Children). An **aggregate root** gets the full slice. A developer may override this per entity, but the override must be recorded in `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`.

## Business Rules

```yaml
entities:
  - name: TodoItem
    rules:
      - { name: TitleRequired, condition: "Title must not be empty", errorMessage: "Title is required." }
      - { name: DueDateFuture, condition: "DueDate must be in the future when set", errorMessage: "Due date must be future." }

domainRules:
  - { name: TenantQuotaNotExceeded, appliesTo: [TodoItem], dependsOn: [TenantQuotaPolicy], errorMessage: "Tenant quota exceeded." }
```

Rules use business language here. Exact C# conditions are Phase 3/4 concerns.

### Policy Matrix (Optional)

Use for actor/state dependent outcomes that are difficult to represent as isolated rules.

```yaml
policyMatrices:
  - name: CancellationPolicyMatrix
    dimensions: [RequestedByRole, CurrentStatus]
    outputs: [Allowed, FeePolicy, RefundPolicy]
    rows:
      - { RequestedByRole: Customer, CurrentStatus: Placed, Allowed: true, FeePolicy: None, RefundPolicy: Full }
      - { RequestedByRole: Customer, CurrentStatus: InTransit, Allowed: true, FeePolicy: Partial, RefundPolicy: Partial }
```

## State Machines

Define lifecycle states and valid transitions in business terms. States = named business conditions. Transitions = allowed moves with named actions. Guards = business rules that gate transitions.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: TodoItem
    stateMachine:
      field: Status
      initial: None
      states: [None, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled]
      transitions:
        - { from: None, to: InProgress, action: Start }
    customActions:
      - { name: Reschedule, params: [{ name: NewDueDate }] }
```

## Events

### Trigger Types

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `afterCreate` | Raised after an entity is created |
| `afterUpdate` | Raised after any property is updated |
| `afterStatusChange` | Raised after a state machine transition completes |
| `afterAction(<ActionName>)` | Raised after a named custom domain action (e.g., `afterAction(Reschedule)`) |
| `afterDelete` | Raised after an entity is (soft-)deleted |
| `scheduled` | Emitted by a background job or scheduler on a time-based trigger |

```yaml
events:
  - name: TodoItemCreated
    raisedBy: TodoItem
    trigger: afterCreate
    payload: [TenantId, TodoItemId, Title]
  - name: TodoItemCompleted
    raisedBy: TodoItem
    trigger: afterStatusChange
    payload: [TenantId, TodoItemId, CompletedBy]
  - name: TodoItemOverdueSuspected
    raisedBy: TodoItem
    trigger: scheduled
    payload: [TenantId, TodoItemId, DueDate]
  - name: TodoItemRescheduled
    raisedBy: TodoItem
    trigger: afterAction(Reschedule)
    payload: [TenantId, TodoItemId, NewDueDate]
```

## Workflows

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: TodoItemEscalation
    pattern: orchestrator
    involvedEntities: [TodoItem, Team, TeamMember, Reminder]
    steps:
      - "Check overdue items"
      - "Notify member"
      - "Escalate after threshold"
    compensationRequired: true
    compensation:
      rollbackOrder: reverse-step-order
      rules:
        - { onFailureOfStep: "Notify member", compensationAction: "Cancel queued notification" }
        - { onFailureOfStep: "Escalate after threshold", compensationAction: "Revoke escalation and reset status" }
    notes: "Thresholds configurable per tenant"
```

Skip workflows when CRUD + state transitions suffice. Add workflows when multiple entities must coordinate in sequence, steps may fail and need compensation, or async waits/escalations are involved.

### Ingestion Semantics and Entitlement Policy - Phase 2

`ingestionSemantics` (ordering, lateness, watermark, out-of-order handling) and `entitlementPolicy` (grant-source priority, conflict resolution, revoke behavior) are **Phase 2 blocks**, not Phase 1 ones. They describe partition and provider behavior, so they belong next to the store and messaging choices that realize them. Record the business expectation in `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` here, then write the block itself in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`. Owner and field list for both: [resource-implementation-schema.md](resource-implementation-schema.md) section Ingestion Semantics, plus its Policy Inputs section for `entitlementPolicy`. Do not write either block into `domain-specification.yaml`.

### Content Lifecycle Policy (Optional)

Use for publish/schedule/rollback scenarios.

```yaml
contentLifecyclePolicy:
  supportsDraftSnapshot: true
  supportsPublishedSnapshot: true
  rollbackStrategy: prior-published-version
  scheduledPublishIdempotent: true
```

### UGC Lifecycle Policy (Optional)

Use for comments/favorites and moderation-sensitive interactions.

```yaml
ugcLifecyclePolicy:
  moderationMode: post-moderation
  visibilityStates: [Visible, Hidden, Removed]
  softDeleteEnabled: true
  authorRedactionSupported: true
```

## AI Capabilities (Optional)

Capture business-level intent for AI-powered features. No implementation details - those are Phase 2 concerns.

### Semantic Search

Identify entities where users should find results by meaning, not just exact keywords.

```yaml
aiCapabilities:
  search:
    - entity: Product
      searchableFields: [Name, Description, Tags]
      intent: "Users find products by describing what they need, not exact keywords"
    - entity: KnowledgeArticle
      searchableFields: [Title, Body, Summary]
      intent: "Support agents find relevant articles from customer problem descriptions"
```

### Agent Workflows

Identify decisions or processes where an AI agent could assist. Focus on what the agent should accomplish, not how.

```yaml
  agentWorkflows:
    - name: CustomerSupportTriage
      description: "Classify incoming support requests and route to the right team"
      involvedEntities: [SupportTicket, Team, KnowledgeArticle]
      humanInLoop: true
      decisions:
        - "Determine urgency and category"
        - "Find relevant knowledge articles"
        - "Suggest resolution or escalation path"
    - name: ContentSummarizer
      description: "Generate summaries of long-form content for preview cards"
      involvedEntities: [Article]
      humanInLoop: false
      decisions:
        - "Extract key points from article body"
```

Add AI capabilities when search should be meaning-based (not just keyword filters), decisions involve classification/ranking/NL reasoning, or content generation/summarization is needed. Implementation details (models, indexes, prompts) are Phase 2/4 concerns - see [skills/ai-integration.md](../skills/ai-integration.md).

## Enterprise Ontology Alignment (Optional)

Opt in by declaring a top-level `ontology:` block. Its presence makes `.scaffold/ontology/` a generated Phase 1 output (owner: [../support/ontology-projection.md](../support/ontology-projection.md)); its absence changes nothing. The interview asks the question once - see [shared-understanding-interview.md](shared-understanding-interview.md) section Enterprise Model Alignment Decision.

```yaml
ontology:
  namespace: https://example.com/ontology/workboard/     # IRI base, ends in / or #
  boundedContext: WorkBoard                               # optional, defaults to ProjectName
  owner: Delivery Operations
  alignsWith:
    - name: Enterprise Work Model
      namespace: https://example.com/ontology/enterprise/

entities:
  - name: Project
    synonyms: [Initiative]
    systemOfRecord: true
    alignment:
      specializes: https://example.com/ontology/enterprise/WorkContainer
    children:
      - { name: WorkItems, entity: WorkItem, relationship: one-to-many, predicate: has }
  - name: Incident
    extends: WorkItem
    navigation:
      - { name: Project, entity: Project, required: true, predicate: belongsTo }
```

| Field | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace` | `ontology` | IRI base for every concept in this module; required when the block exists. |
| `boundedContext` | `ontology` | Label for the module; defaults to `ProjectName`. |
| `owner` | `ontology` | Team or role that owns the module, in business language. |
| `alignsWith[]` | `ontology` | Upstream or enterprise models (`name`, `namespace`) that `alignment` IRIs may point into. |
| `extends` | entity | This entity is a kind of another entity in this file (is-a). |
| `synonyms[]` | entity, value object | Accepted alternate names. |
| `owner` | entity | Overrides `ontology.owner` for one concept. |
| `systemOfRecord` | entity | `true` (default) this app masters the concept; `false` it consumes it from another system. |
| `alignment.equivalentTo` / `alignment.specializes` | entity, value object | This concept is the same as, or a specialization of, an external concept IRI. |
| `predicate` | child and navigation relationship | Verb read from the declaring entity (`has`, `belongsTo`, `assignedTo`). |

Rules:

- `extends` is is-a within this file only. It is how the shared-base-entity advice above (`Notification` with `EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`) becomes expressible; it never replaces `children` or `navigation` ownership.
- `systemOfRecord: false` marks a consumed concept. Keep the entity in the spec (the app still stores or caches it); the projection tells the enterprise model who masters it.
- `synonyms` are accepted alternates. A term listed under Rejected Synonyms in `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` never appears here.
- `sensitive: true` is exported as `pii`. Phase 1 introduces no separate classification taxonomy; graded classification stays a Phase 2 compliance concern.

---

## Tenancy & Auth Model

```yaml
multiTenant: true
tenantIsolation: "row-level"     # row-level | schema | database
globalAdminRole: GlobalAdmin
authProvider: EntraID             # EntraID | EntraExternal | Google | Facebook | Apple | OAuth2 | None
authScenario: enterprise          # enterprise | external | hybrid
```

Auth provider options:
- **Enterprise / internal:** `EntraID` - SSO, conditional access, group-based roles
- **External / consumer:** `EntraExternal`, `Google`, `Facebook`, `Apple`, `OAuth2` - social/OIDC providers
- **Hybrid:** combine `EntraID` for internal with `EntraExternal` or social providers for external users

> **Note:** Authentication is configured in the final integration phase (Phase 5e). During earlier phases, auth is stubbed. See [skills/identity-management.md](../skills/identity-management.md).

---

## Discovery Conversation Pattern

Work through these in order during Phase 1 after loading [shared-understanding-interview.md](shared-understanding-interview.md):

1. **Core entities** - what does the business call things?
2. **Relationships and ownership** - who owns what? What references what? Which entities are aggregate roots?
3. **Value objects** - which values carry business meaning, validation, behavior, or equality beyond their primitive fields?
4. **Lifecycle** - what states does each entity go through?
5. **Rules and invariants** - what must be true? What constraints belong inside the domain model?
6. **Events** - what happened that other parts of the system care about?
7. **Workflows** - what multi-step processes exist beyond CRUD?
8. **AI capabilities** - what searches should be "smart"? What decisions could an agent help with? What content should be generated or summarized?
9. **Tenancy/auth** - who can see/do what?
10. **Enterprise model alignment** - one question: does this domain align with a shared glossary, upstream ontology, or analytics ontology? Default no.

After each branch, recap the current understanding, confirmed language, design decisions, open conflicts, and deferred items. Do not write final YAML until every branch is confirmed, defaulted, or deferred.

---

## Phase 1 -> 2 Transition Gate

Before moving to Phase 2 (Resource Definition), verify all of the following:

- [ ] `python {instructionsRoot}/scripts/validate-scaffold-artifacts.py --root . --phase 1` exits 0 (`.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` validates against [`schemas/domain-specification.schema.json`](../schemas/domain-specification.schema.json)). Paste the observed output per [../support/execution-gates.md](../support/execution-gates.md) section Verification Evidence Rule. This is the mechanical half of the gate; the reviewed items below are the half a schema cannot check.
- [ ] Every entity has `name` and at least one `property`. `isTenantEntity` defaults to `true` - declare it only to override that; a multi-tenant spec with a genuinely tenant-independent entity must say so explicitly
- [ ] Every relationship references an entity defined in this file
- [ ] Each entity is classified aggregate **root** or **owned child** (derived from `children`/`navigation`, or pinned via `aggregateRole`); any non-default `aggregateRole` override is recorded in `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` (drives GR-15 write-surface generation)
- [ ] Every `kind: value_object` property references a `valueObjects[].name`; each value object has fields, rules if any, and `usedBy` references existing entity properties
- [ ] No entity names collide with C# reserved types (`Task`, `Thread`, `Timer`, `Type`, `String`, `Object`, `Action`, `Attribute`, `File`, `Path`)
- [ ] State machine `states` list matches `transitions` from/to values (no orphaned states or transitions)
- [ ] Every event `raisedBy` references a defined entity
- [ ] `ProjectName` is set and valid (PascalCase, no spaces)
- [ ] `projectNamePrefix` is set (`solution-name` or `none`), confirmed with the developer, and recorded in `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] At least one entity is defined
- [ ] If `aiCapabilities` is defined: every referenced entity exists, every `agentWorkflows` entry references defined entities, and `searchableFields` reference defined properties
- [ ] If `ontology` is defined: `namespace` is set, every `extends` names an entity in this file, and `python {instructionsRoot}/scripts/generate-ontology.py --root . --check` exits 0 after generating `.scaffold/ontology/`
- [ ] `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` contains every entity, state, event, command/action, role, policy, and value object name from this file
- [ ] `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` records non-obvious choices and marks each blocking Phase 2 decision `confirmed`, `defaulted`, or `deferred`
