# Scaffold AI - New .NET App/Service Scaffolding

Pragmatic instruction set for AI-assisted scaffolding of C#/.NET applications and services.

**Profile structure.** Phase 1 (domain discovery, ubiquitous language, design decisions) is a **universal core** - stack-agnostic and reusable. Phases 2-5 (resource definition, planning, contracts, implementation) run under the **C#/.NET/Azure profile** indexed at [profiles/csharp-dotnet-azure.md](profiles/csharp-dotnet-azure.md). That is the only profile shipped today; the boundary is documented so a second profile (e.g. TypeScript/Node, Python/FastAPI) could plug in later without restructuring the repo.

## AI Agents & Harnesses - Quick Start

Clone this repo then run the install script to copy the instruction files into any target app repository root folder. The installer copies runtime instructions into `<app>/.instructions/` and places thin harness entrypoints at the app root. Scaffold rules stay app-scoped; do not put phase routing, TaskFlow rules, or generated-code conventions in global Codex, Claude, or Copilot instruction files.

### Supported harnesses

Each harness has a project-memory file (auto-loaded on session start) and, where supported, a scoped command/agent picker. `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth: CLI agents and GitHub Copilot agent surfaces read it natively, and `CLAUDE.md` is an `@AGENTS.md` import stub that delivers the same content to Claude Code. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` remains a thin stub for older Copilot clients and non-agent surfaces. The installer writes all three so any agent that opens the repo finds its native entrypoint.

These files are two-region by design. The **installer-managed block** (inside `<!-- ai-scaffold: start --> ... <!-- ai-scaffold: end -->` markers) stays minimal and durable: in `AGENTS.md`, a vertical-slice pointer, a single demoted full-scaffold/adopt pointer, and a conditional graphify block that activates only when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists; in `CLAUDE.md`, just the `@AGENTS.md` import. **App-specific guidance** (app purpose, layering, build/test/run, pointers to `.scaffold/` docs) is authored *outside* the markers in `AGENTS.md` at scaffold completion - see [support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](support/final-scaffold-checklist.md) section Finalize Harness Entrypoints - and is preserved across re-installs. Scaffold/adopt are one-time bootstrap events, so they are demoted out of the always-loaded surface rather than kept prominent; the `.instructions/` payload and scoped commands/agents still ship for when they are needed.

| Harness | Project-memory file | Scoped command/agent picker | Full scaffold | Vertical slice | Brownfield adoption |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI (and other CLI agents that read `AGENTS.md`) | `AGENTS.md` | - (no stable convention yet) | Prompt: `Load .instructions/START-AI.md and run the scaffold router` | Prompt: `Load .instructions/support/vertical-slice-checklist.md` | Prompt: `Load .instructions/ai/adopt-codebase.md and run the adoption flow` |
| GitHub Copilot in VS Code | `AGENTS.md` (native; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` stub for older clients / non-agent surfaces) | `.github/agents/` | Select `dotnet-scaffold` agent | Select `vertical-slice` agent | Select `scaffold-adopt` agent |
| Claude Code / Claude VS Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/commands/` | `/scaffold <domain>` | `/vertical-slice <Entity>` | `/scaffold-adopt` |
| Generic AI assistant | - (point it at `.instructions/START-AI.md` manually) | - | Prompt: `Load .instructions/START-AI.md and run the scaffold router` | Prompt: `Load .instructions/support/vertical-slice-checklist.md` | Prompt: `Load .instructions/ai/adopt-codebase.md and run the adoption flow` |

All harnesses follow the same flow: scaffold sessions boot from `.instructions/START-AI.md`, resume from `HANDOFF.md` if present, run one phase, write `HANDOFF.md`, stop. Vertical-slice sessions load `.instructions/support/vertical-slice-checklist.md` and generate one full entity stack against the gate. **Brownfield adoption** replaces the Phase 1 interview with a code-inspection pass that derives `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml`, `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`, and `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` from the existing solution; the project then continues into Phase 2 identically to a greenfield scaffold. Detail: [ai/adopt-codebase.md](ai/adopt-codebase.md).

In installed app repositories, `.instructions/` is runtime payload and should be treated as read-only during scaffold work. Record instruction feedback in `.scaffold/INSTRUCTION-GAPS.md`; maintainers fold approved gaps back into this source repo later.

Canonical execution rules: [START-AI.md](START-AI.md) (session model, phase router) and [support/execution-gates.md](support/execution-gates.md) (gate commands).

### Install into a new app

Use `install-to-project.py` from a local clone of this repo. It copies only the runtime payload - instruction files, scoped agents, CLI entrypoint, and slash commands - into your app, and skips repo-maintenance files (tests, CI workflows, global assistant instruction files, git hooks, virtualenvs).

Do not install this payload into the TaskFlow reference app (`scaffold-proof`) during normal maintenance. TaskFlow is the proof/reference implementation that these instructions point to; it should not carry its own `.instructions/` copy unless you are deliberately testing installer behavior.

`--target` is the **app repo root** (not the `.instructions/` folder). The script creates `<target>/.instructions/` if it does not exist, and writes harness entrypoints (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.claude/commands/`, `.github/agents/`) at the target root so CLI agents, Claude, and Copilot discover the scoped scaffold instructions. Root-level `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`copilot-instructions.md` scaffold content is written inside sentinel markers (`<!-- ai-scaffold: start --> ... <!-- ai-scaffold: end -->`) so re-running the installer is idempotent; existing user content outside the markers is preserved. Each install regenerates `.instructions/.scaffold-install-manifest.json` with the managed paths, SHA-256 content hashes, and source repository plus commit when Git can resolve them. This is ownership and diagnostic evidence, not an instruction-set or dependency version constraint.

```bash
# from a clone of this repo
python scripts/install-to-project.py --target /path/to/your-app-repo
# tip: run with --dry-run first to preview what gets copied
```

**Windows Python launcher fallback chain.** Install Python once per machine or user profile; do not rely on a repo-specific launcher for scaffold work across repos. Verify the install with [support/python-setup.md](support/python-setup.md). Try in order; the first one that prints a version is the one to use for every `scripts/*.py` invocation:

```powershell
python --version            # may resolve to Microsoft-Store stub; if it errors, try the next
py -3 --version             # works only when the Python launcher (py.exe) is installed
.venv\Scripts\python.exe --version   # source-repo fallback only; not the preferred cross-repo setup
```

Then call the script with the same machine/user-global launcher, e.g. `python scripts/install-to-project.py --target C:\path\to\your-app` or `py -3 scripts/install-to-project.py --target ...`. Use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` only as a local authoring fallback. The same fallback applies to `configure-ef-packages-feed.py`, `validate-instructions.py`, and any other `scripts/*.py` invocation.

What it places:

| Source in this repo | Destination in your app | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `START-AI.md`, `GROUND-RULES.md` | `<app>/.instructions/` | copy |
| `ai/`, `patterns/`, `profiles/`, `schemas/`, `skills/`, `support/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` | `<app>/.instructions/` | copy |
| `AGENTS.md` | `<app>/AGENTS.md` (Codex-style CLI agents) | merge |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `<app>/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code project memory) | merge |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `<app>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot global guidance) | merge |
| `.claude/commands/` | `<app>/.claude/commands/` (Claude slash commands) | dir |
| `.github/agents/` | `<app>/.github/agents/` (Copilot scoped agents) | dir |

**Merge mode** writes the durable harness block inside `<!-- ai-scaffold: start --> ... <!-- ai-scaffold: end -->` markers. Existing user content outside the markers is preserved (including the app-specific summary authored at scaffold completion), and an older unmarked scaffold-only copy is converted into a single marked block.

Flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print planned copies without writing anything. |
| `--update` | Deprecated no-op, kept for compatibility. Installs are always content-aware: identical target files are skipped (`[unchanged]`), differing ones are overwritten and listed (installed `.instructions/` is read-only per GR-07, so the source is SSOT). `HANDOFF.md` is always left untouched. |
| `--instructions-only` | Copy only `<app>/.instructions/`; skip `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/commands/`, and `.github/agents/` placement (useful if you manage those separately). |
| `--verify` | After install, verify every manifest-managed file and marker block against its SHA-256 hash. Missing or changed managed content fails; unmanifested files warn and remain untouched. |
| `--verify-only` | Skip install entirely; run the same manifest integrity check against an existing target. Verification scope follows the manifest's recorded scope (`full` or `instructions-only`). Useful in CI or to confirm an unfamiliar repo is correctly wired. |

After install:

- [ ] Decide the shared base-type strategy (`packageStrategy` in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`):
  - `feed` - consume `<packagePrefix>.*` from a private NuGet feed. Configure with `python .instructions/scripts/configure-ef-packages-feed.py --root . --feed-url https://nuget.pkg.github.com/{owner}/index.json --username {github-user} --prefix {packagePrefix}`.
  - `local` - no private feed. Phase 4 generates `src/Packages/<packagePrefix>.*` packable projects you can publish later.
  - `hybrid` - feed plus a `localPackageLayers` list for any gaps. Run the helper above for feed access; locally-generated projects use the same prefix.
- [ ] Confirm `dotnet restore` exits 0.
- [ ] Phase gates rely on `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`; the scaffold checklist at `support/final-scaffold-checklist.md` covers end-to-end acceptance.

### Manual copy (alternative)

If you prefer to copy by hand: harness discovery files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`) live at the **app repo root**, not inside `.instructions/`. Everything else goes under `.instructions/`. Do not copy scaffold routing into a developer's global assistant instruction files - the per-app placement is what keeps scope correct. The install script above does this automatically and handles the merge into existing root-level files.

## Purpose

This instruction set turns an AI coding assistant into a guided scaffolding engine for production-grade C#/.NET solutions. Instead of generating throwaway boilerplate, it drives a structured five-phase process - from domain discovery through implementation - producing consistent, buildable, testable code that follows clean architecture and the conventions of a mature engineering team.

The goal is not to replace engineering judgment but to compress the multi day/week "green-field to first vertical slice" timeline down to hours, with guardrails that prevent common shortcuts (missing tests, leaky abstractions, inconsistent naming).

Phase 1 also creates durable collaboration artifacts before code planning starts:

- `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` records accepted domain terms, rejected synonyms, states, commands/actions, roles, events, policies, and naming guidance so later AI sessions use consistent expressions.
- `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` records design choices and dependencies between decisions, so downstream resource and code choices do not silently contradict earlier domain answers.

### Phase-1 Artifact Lifecycle

> **Rule of thumb:** *Fix the artifact first, then the code. When drift exists, the artifact loses to code reality.*

`.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml`, `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`, and `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` are **living source of truth**, not snapshots. Every phase consumes them, so they must stay current as the project evolves - otherwise later AI sessions reason from a stale model and naming/decision drift creeps in.

This rule is enforced at every session boundary: [START-AI.md](START-AI.md) section Phase-1 Artifact Lifecycle Rule, [ai/SKILL.md](ai/SKILL.md) section Non-Negotiables, [support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](support/final-scaffold-checklist.md) section Completion Criteria, and the per-session check in [support/HANDOFF.md](support/HANDOFF.md) section Phase-1 Artifact Currency.

**When to update each:**

- **New entity, term, role, event, or domain action** -> append the term to `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` and update the relevant section of `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` (entity, customAction, event, etc.) before generating code. The `/vertical-slice` checklist enforces this as a pre-flight step.
- **New design choice or revision of an earlier one** -> append to `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`. Do not silently rewrite earlier entries; mark the prior decision as superseded and link forward, so the dependency graph remains traceable.
- **Schema or relationship change** -> update `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` first, then propagate to EF configuration, repositories, DTOs, mappers, and tests in that order.
- **Spec edit while `.scaffold/ontology/` exists** -> regenerate the projection in the same session (`python .instructions/scripts/generate-ontology.py --root .`); never hand-edit it. Owner: [support/ontology-projection.md](support/ontology-projection.md).

**Drift signal.** If `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md` and code identifiers diverge, the doc is wrong, not the code (per [support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](support/final-scaffold-checklist.md) language-failure rule). Update the doc to match accepted reality before changing code names. The same applies to `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` - if the implemented architecture has moved past a recorded decision, supersede the entry rather than leaving the doc to contradict the code.

**Mid-scaffold corrections.** When a domain misunderstanding surfaces mid-Phase-5 (entity purpose wrong, term mismatched, decision violated), [support/OPERATIONS.md](support/OPERATIONS.md) is the canonical recovery path: clarify with the user, update the Phase-1 artifacts, then re-scaffold the affected slice.

**Shrink as code matures.** Once code and tests express a fact (structure, wiring, method behavior), delete artifact prose that merely restates it - two overlapping sources of truth make later sessions average across them instead of obeying one. The artifacts converge toward what code cannot express: rationale, non-goals, key invariants, external contracts, and compliance constraints. This prunes content within the artifacts; it never removes the artifacts themselves (next rule).

**Do not delete.** These artifacts are the onboarding surface for every future AI session, code reviewer, and new team member. Keep them in the repo root for the life of the project - even when they grow long, the cost of reading them is far lower than the cost of an AI session reasoning from absent context.

## Phases

Each phase runs in its own AI session and produces artifacts the next phase consumes.

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **1 - Domain Discovery** *(universal)* | Structured interview to reach shared understanding, define ubiquitous language, resolve decision dependencies, and capture entities, relationships, events, workflows, and business rules in pure business language - no implementation details. | `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml`, `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`, `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`; `.scaffold/ontology/` (opt-in, generated) |
| **2 - Resource Definition** *(C#/.NET/Azure profile)* | Map each resource requirement to concrete technology choices - data stores, messaging, AI capabilities, hosting models. | `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` |
| **3 - Implementation Planning** *(C#/.NET/Azure profile)* | Resolve open questions, verify tooling (NuGet feeds, CLIs), discover project-specific CLIs and MCP servers, and produce a sequenced build plan. | `.scaffold/implementation-plan.md` |
| **4 - Contract Scaffolding** *(C#/.NET/Azure profile)* | Generate solution structure, interfaces, DTOs, entity shells, test infrastructure, and no-op DI stubs. Gate: `dotnet build` succeeds on the full solution. | Compilable skeleton |
| **5 - Implementation (TDD)** *(C#/.NET/Azure profile)* | Build vertical slices entity-by-entity across sub-phases 5a-5e (Foundation, App Core + Runtime, Optional Hosts, Quality + Delivery, Integration). Phase 5a uses test-driven development (write tests first -> red -> implement -> green); 5b is mixed (TDD for app/API, tests-after for runtime); 5c-5e are tests-after. | Production code + passing tests |

Phase 1 is stack-agnostic; Phase 2+ is the C#/.NET/Azure profile. See [profiles/csharp-dotnet-azure.md](profiles/csharp-dotnet-azure.md) for the file index, and [START-AI.md](START-AI.md) section Profiles and section Phase Router for routing detail.

## Ground Rules

A 1-page index of the binding rules every scaffold session honors lives at [GROUND-RULES.md](GROUND-RULES.md). The rules carry stable `GR-NN` identifiers so phase gates, skills, and templates can cite the rule they enforce without restating it. Detail enforcement remains in [ai/SKILL.md](ai/SKILL.md) section Non-Negotiables, [support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](support/final-scaffold-checklist.md) for composite acceptance, [START-AI.md](START-AI.md) section Phase-1 Artifact Lifecycle Rule, and [support/execution-gates.md](support/execution-gates.md) for gate commands - the index does not replace them.

## Approach

The instruction set is designed around three core ideas:

**1. Phased workflow with TDD.**
Five phases prevent hallucinated architecture by ensuring verified context before code is written. Phase 4 produces a compilable skeleton so that Phase 5a/5b can follow a strict red/green TDD cycle - tests are written against contracts before any implementation exists. See [ai/tdd-protocol.md](ai/tdd-protocol.md).

**2. Skills and templates as composable units.**
Implementation knowledge is split into focused skill files (how things work) and template files plus a `templates/index.md` index (what to generate). The Phase Router in `START-AI.md` and the Phase 5 file table in `ai/SKILL.md` tell the agent which files to load for the current phase or sub-phase.

**3. Composition patterns, not documentation alone.**
Pattern files in `patterns/` document how generated components wire together across projects - database context pooling, API startup sequences, request context resolution, cache configuration, and Aspire resource wiring. The pattern index lives in `ai/SKILL.md` section Non-Negotiables (one bullet per pattern, with the phase to load it). This grounds the generated output in proven, real-world patterns rather than abstract descriptions.

## Reference Application

A companion reference app - **TaskFlow** - provides executable proof for many high-value patterns: dual DbContext pooling, YARP gateway, Aspire orchestration, FusionCache + Redis backplane, TickerQ scheduling, Azure Functions, multi-tenancy, scaffold-mode auth, Uno WASM UI, Blazor UI, and React/Vite UI. Its canonical capability matrix distinguishes `proven`, `deployment-only`, `documented-only`, and `not enabled`; see [support/reference-app.md](support/reference-app.md).

TaskFlow is a reference/proof target, not a normal install target for `.instructions/`. Keep scaffold runtime instructions in this repository and consult TaskFlow through [support/reference-app.md](support/reference-app.md) and [support/taskflow-proof-map.md](support/taskflow-proof-map.md).

**Repository:** <https://github.com/efreeman518/scaffold-proof>

For consultation rules, AI access (local clone vs GitHub MCP), and the phase -> area pointer map, see [support/reference-app.md](support/reference-app.md) and [support/taskflow-proof-map.md](support/taskflow-proof-map.md).

## Quick Start

If you want the shortest path from zero context to first scaffold:

1. Create a new app repo.
2. Run `python scripts/install-to-project.py --target /path/to/your-app-repo --verify` from this repo.
3. Start through the harness table above: `AGENTS.md`, Copilot agent, Claude command, or a prompt that loads `.instructions/START-AI.md`.

**First time?** Use the [Minimum Viable Scaffold (MVS)](support/minimum-viable-scaffold.md) - concise overlays for the canonical phase prompts (with Phase 5 split into 5a + 5b sessions) that produce an API-only app with one entity, no Gateway/UI/AI/messaging. You can promote to a richer profile once the loop feels familiar.

Read the rest of this guide when you need setup details, MCP recommendations, or troubleshooting rules.

## Prerequisites

- `git`
- A current machine- or user-global Python 3 to run `install-to-project.py`, `configure-ef-packages-feed.py`, and `validate-instructions.py`; see [support/python-setup.md](support/python-setup.md). **On Windows, no single launcher is universal:** `py -3` works on machines with the Python launcher installed, and the bare `python` command works when a real Python is on PATH (it may resolve to the Microsoft-Store stub if not). Run `where python` and `where py` to see what's available, then pick the one that prints a real path. `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` is acceptable for source-repo authoring, but it is not the preferred cross-repo setup. The scripts have no Python-version-specific syntax - any current 3.x works.
- Latest stable `.NET SDK`
- Docker engine running (Docker Desktop not required) - Aspire relies on it for hosting local container services
- VS Code + AI assistant
- Local SQL Server/Azure SQL access for dev scenarios
- For `packageStrategy: feed` or `hybrid` only - read access to the configured private NuGet feed (e.g., GitHub Packages for the canonical `EF.*` example); expose via `NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN` or an approved credential provider before Phase 3/4 restore. `packageStrategy: local` skips this entirely.
- If using Uno UI:
  - `dotnet new install Uno.Templates`
  - `dotnet tool install -g uno.check` then `uno-check`
  - `dotnet workload install wasm-tools android`
  - `dotnet workload install ios` only when an iOS compile gate or macOS/iOS CI job is in scope
  - `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.OpenApi.Kiota`
  - For Android local testing: Android Studio or command-line SDK tools with Platform-Tools, Android Emulator, one recent platform, and one AVD.
- If using React UI: current Node.js LTS plus npm.

Version policy: prefer latest stable packages and SDKs.

### Shared Base-Type Packaging

Phase 2 resolves how shared base-type contracts (entity bases, repository bases, request context, results, paged response, specifications, messaging interfaces) are sourced. Three modes live in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` under `packageStrategy`:

- **`feed`** - pre-built NuGet packages consumed from `customNugetFeeds` (e.g., the canonical `EF.*` example on GitHub Packages). Requires feed read access.
- **`local`** - no private feed. Phase 4 generates one packable project per layer in `localPackageLayers` under `src/Packages/<packagePrefix>.<Layer>`. The solution consumes them via `<ProjectReference>`. Publish later with `dotnet pack` and migrate to `feed` when ready.
- **`hybrid`** - feed plus locally-generated gaps. Layers the feed lacks live in `localPackageLayers` under the same prefix so they can be pushed into the feed later without renaming.

`packagePrefix` is required in every mode; `EF` is the canonical example used throughout these instructions.

#### `feed` or `hybrid` - Private Feed Setup

Local restore requires package read access through `NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN` or an approved credential provider.

Set the token in your shell rather than committing secrets or pasting PATs into chat:

```powershell
$env:NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN = "<package-read-token>"
```

Then ensure `nuget.config` maps `<packagePrefix>.*` to the private feed and uses `%NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN%` for the feed password. Configure once, then verify with `dotnet restore`:

```powershell
python .instructions/scripts/configure-ef-packages-feed.py --root . --feed-url https://nuget.pkg.github.com/{owner}/index.json --username {github-user} --prefix {packagePrefix}
dotnet restore
```

Never commit a PAT. CI should inject the same token through secret variables.

#### `local` - No Feed Setup Needed

`nuget.config` only needs `nuget.org` (the file may be absent and NuGet's default applies). Phase 4 generates the packable projects from `localPackageLayers`. Verify with `dotnet restore` after Phase 4 - no auth token required.

## Repository Setup

1. Create a new empty app repo.
2. Install this instruction set with `python scripts/install-to-project.py --target /path/to/your-app-repo`.
3. Open the app repo in VS Code or your CLI harness.

Expected shape (note `AGENTS.md`, `.github/agents/`, and `.claude/commands/` live at the app repo root, not inside `.instructions/`):

```text
<YourApp>/
  AGENTS.md                       # CLI agents discover here; loads .instructions/START-AI.md only on explicit scaffold request
  .github/
    agents/                        # Copilot discovers scoped agents here
      dotnet-scaffold.agent.md
      vertical-slice.agent.md
  .claude/
    commands/                      # Claude discovers scoped commands here
      scaffold.md
      vertical-slice.md
  .instructions/
    README.md
    AGENTS.md
    START-AI.md
    ai/
      SKILL.md
      domain-specification-schema.md
      resource-implementation-schema.md
      implementation-plan.md
      placeholder-tokens.md
    profiles/
      csharp-dotnet-azure.md       # active stack profile (file index)
    support/
      HANDOFF.md
      operator-setup.md
      execution-gates.md
      troubleshooting.md
    skills/
    scripts/
    templates/
    schemas/
  README.md
```

Notes:
- `.instructions/support/HANDOFF.md` is the template.
- A working `HANDOFF.md` is created in the target project root at the end of every phase and updated after each Phase 5 sub-phase.

## Recommended MCP Servers

> **Prefer CLI over MCP when both exist.** CLI tools have lower token cost and faster execution. Use MCP servers for interactive exploration or when no CLI equivalent is available.

### Core (always on)

| Server | Why | CLI alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Docs MCP | Official .NET/Azure docs, samples, full-page retrieval | - |
| Context7 MCP | Third-party library/API docs | - |

### Enable by phase

| Server | Enable when | CLI alternative |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub MCP | Repo workflows, issues/PRs, CI visibility | `gh` CLI (preferred) |
| Azure MCP | IaC/deployment/resource validation | `az` CLI (preferred) |
| Playwright MCP | UI E2E validation/debugging | - |
| Fetch MCP | Pull external specs/docs into markdown | `curl` / `Invoke-RestMethod` |
Optional additions: Git, Docker (`docker` CLI preferred), Memory, web-search MCPs, Azure DevOps MCP (`az devops` CLI preferred).

### Tooling discovery

Phase 3 analyzes `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` technology choices and actively researches available CLIs and MCP servers for the project's specific libraries and services. Results are recorded in the implementation plan's **Tooling & Environment Readiness** section and verified at the start of each subsequent phase.

**CLI -> MCP -> online resources:** Prefer CLI tools first (lowest token cost), then MCP servers for interactive exploration, then documentation URLs and GitHub repos the AI can fetch during implementation.

## Model Tier by Phase

> **Quality first - the scaffold is built once and read for the project's life.** The default tier is **high-capability for every phase**. A cheaper tier is an opt-in cost lever only where the work is mechanical and fully build/test-verified; it is never a recommendation, and never appropriate on reasoning-heavy phases. When uncertain, stay higher. Model tier is operator- and harness-controlled (the operator selects it at session start, since the workflow is one phase per session); if your harness cannot select a model, ignore this section and continue. Per **GR-08** this guidance names capability tiers by characteristic only - never a model id or version, which would go stale on every release.

### Tiers

| Tier | Use for | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Reasoning | Domain modeling, ambiguity resolution, design, integration nuance | Deepest multi-step reasoning; highest cost; slowest |
| Balanced | Well-specified implementation against a fixed design | Solid coding capability; moderate cost |
| Fast | Deterministic, mechanical, fully build/test-verifiable work | Lowest cost; fastest; weakest reasoning |

### Recommended tier by phase

| Phase | Recommended tier | Cost-lever note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 - Domain discovery (interview) | Reasoning | Never downgrade - ambiguity and dependency-ordered decisions set everything downstream |
| 2 - Resource definition | Reasoning | Technology and dependency-mode choices |
| 3 - Implementation planning | Reasoning | Sequencing and open-question resolution |
| 4 - Contract scaffolding | Reasoning | Errors here cascade into all of Phase 5; fast tier only to re-generate boilerplate after the design is fixed, gated on a green build |
| 5a/5b - Foundation + app core (TDD) | Reasoning / Balanced | Keep high for domain logic and test design |
| 5c - Optional hosts | Balanced | |
| 5d - Quality + delivery | Balanced | Fast tier for mechanical config/doc generation only under green tests |
| 5e - Integration (auth + AI) | Reasoning | Auth and AI wiring carry the most subtle failure modes |
| Cross-cutting: rollback structural decisions, mixed-store consistency design ([support/OPERATIONS.md](support/OPERATIONS.md)) | Reasoning | Structural calls are expensive to get wrong |

When in doubt, stay on the higher tier - the token saving is one-time, the output is permanent.

## Where Things Live

A short map of the repo so you know which directory owns what kind of content. Useful when deciding where to put a new instruction or fix.

| Folder | Owns | Loaded when |
|---|---|---|
| Root project-memory files: `AGENTS.md` (SSOT - read natively by CLI agents and Copilot agent surfaces), `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md` import stub for Claude Code), `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (stub for older / non-agent Copilot surfaces) | Harness discovery and explicit scaffold trigger detection | Auto-loaded by the harness; must stay thin |
| Root scoped pickers: `.claude/commands/` (Claude slash commands), `.github/agents/` (Copilot agent picker) | Harness-specific scaffold launchers | Selected only for scaffold, vertical-slice, or brownfield-adoption work |
| `START-AI.md` in this repo / `.instructions/START-AI.md` in installed apps | Canonical bootstrap: session router, phase router, load rules, reference-app pointer | Loaded only after explicit scaffold request |
| `ai/` | Phase orchestration: schemas, interview, contract scaffolding, TDD protocol, placeholder tokens, Phase 5 file table (`SKILL.md`) | Per-phase routing |
| `profiles/` | Per-stack profile indexes. Lists which Phase 2-5 files belong to each profile. Today: `csharp-dotnet-azure.md` (the only profile shipped) | Reference; consulted to confirm the active stack mapping |
| `skills/` | Reusable how-to per concern (domain, data, API, gateway, caching, identity, testing, UI, etc.) | Per-sub-phase, by `SKILL.md` file table |
| `templates/` | Code-shape templates for generated artifacts (entity, EF config, repository, service, endpoint, tests) | Per-sub-phase, paired with the matching skill |
| `patterns/` | Cross-project wiring (data layer, API host, infrastructure, expected output) | On-demand; index in `ai/SKILL.md` section Non-Negotiables |
| `support/` | Operator-facing detail: execution gates, operations protocols, troubleshooting, HANDOFF template, MVS, golden path, prompt catalog, reference-app proof map | On failure, on session boundary, or on need |
| `schemas/` | JSON Schemas for `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` and `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` | Phase 1/2 validation |
| `scripts/` | Author + operator tooling: install-to-project, configure-ef-packages-feed, generate-ontology, validate-instructions | One-off |

Rule of thumb when adding new content: it goes in `skills/` if it's "how to do X", in `templates/` if it's "the shape of the file you generate", in `patterns/` if it's "how multiple projects wire together", in `support/` if it's operator-facing, and in `ai/` only if it's phase orchestration the AI needs at session start.

## Mode Selection

| Need | Mode |
|---|---|
| Fast internal tool, minimal infra | `scaffoldMode: lite` |
| Production-ready with optional hosts | `scaffoldMode: full` |
| Smallest viable scaffold (single API, defaults to all optional hosts off) | `scaffoldMode: api-only` |

`scaffoldMode` drives load-set sizing per Phase 5 sub-phase; the optional-host toggles (`includeGateway`, `includeUnoUI`, `includeReactUI`, `includeScheduler`, etc.) are independent flags in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` and can be enabled in any mode. `api-only` simply biases the defaults toward "off".

Defaults: [ai/resource-implementation-schema.md](ai/resource-implementation-schema.md) **Canonical Defaults**. Load-set sizing: [ai/SKILL.md](ai/SKILL.md) section Load-Set Sizing.

## Scalability and Hosting Lanes

Phase 2 defaults to one Azure lane. Add another lane only when it must ship, then declare independent provider switches and executable proof for that lane instead of forking the application architecture. Workload-envelope questions, lane/provider precedence, health probes, runtime tuning boundaries, portable deployment rules, and the TaskFlow refactor evidence are in [support/scalability-and-hosting.md](support/scalability-and-hosting.md).

## Happy Path

1. Prerequisites and repo setup (see [Quick Start](#quick-start) and [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
2. Phase 1: Domain YAML + language + decisions -> [ai/shared-understanding-interview.md](ai/shared-understanding-interview.md)
3. Phase 2: Resource YAML -> [ai/resource-implementation-schema.md](ai/resource-implementation-schema.md)
4. Phase 3: Implementation plan -> [ai/implementation-plan.md](ai/implementation-plan.md)
5. Phase 4: Contract scaffolding -> [ai/contract-scaffolding.md](ai/contract-scaffolding.md)
6. Phase 5: Implementation (TDD) -> [ai/SKILL.md](ai/SKILL.md) + [ai/tdd-protocol.md](ai/tdd-protocol.md)
7. Validate gates -> [support/execution-gates.md](support/execution-gates.md)
8. Final scaffold check -> [support/final-scaffold-checklist.md](support/final-scaffold-checklist.md)
9. Troubleshoot -> [support/troubleshooting.md](support/troubleshooting.md)

## Prompt Catalog

For copy-paste phase prompts, see [support/prompt-catalog.md](support/prompt-catalog.md). The catalog is a convenience layer for engineers; [START-AI.md](START-AI.md) remains the canonical operational bootstrap for AI execution.

## Context Tooling

This scaffold can use optional context-optimization tools ([rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk),
[headroom](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom),
[graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify)) to cut token cost in AI sessions. They are a separate concern from the scaffold itself - machine and
operator setup, not part of any app's payload, and not required to scaffold or run an app.

Setup, installation, and per-tool details are operator/machine concerns managed separately
and are out of scope for this instruction set. Within the scaffold, the only context-tooling
guidance that matters is the optional per-repo graphify layer choice and material-change refresh timing,
in [support/context-tooling.md](support/context-tooling.md) (reached per repo via a pointer in
[START-AI.md](START-AI.md)).

## Operational References

Useful script entrypoints:

- `scripts/install-to-project.py` - copy the runtime payload into a consumer app's `.instructions/` directory and place harness entrypoints at the app root. The bounded install manifest enables full managed-content verification and safe pruning of upstream-removed content; a locally changed removed file or managed block is preserved and reported as a conflict, and the install aborts before copying anything. `--verify-only` checks integrity without copying.
- `scripts/configure-ef-packages-feed.py` - create/update target-app `nuget.config` for any private NuGet feed without writing PATs. Pass `--prefix <packagePrefix>` to map the appropriate `<packagePrefix>.*` pattern; the canonical EF.* example is the default. Only run for `packageStrategy: feed` or `hybrid`.
- `scripts/validate-instructions.py` - author-side sanity check: relative-link integrity, phase-label canonical set, harness command-file shape, payload shape vs installer declaration, and golden-path YAML vs `schemas/*.schema.json` (full jsonschema validation when `pyyaml` + `jsonschema` are installed; stdlib structural checks otherwise). Run before committing edits to instruction files; CI runs it on every push via `.github/workflows/validate.yml`.
- `scripts/validate-reference.py --reference-root <path>` - validate TaskFlow contracts against current schemas, tracked Markdown links, proof-map paths, explicit feature flags, high-value feature sentinels, and immutable workflow action refs. TaskFlow CI checks out the scaffold's current `main` branch and records the exact commit used as diagnostic evidence.
- `tests/golden-path/run-golden-path.py` - author-side end-to-end regression: drives headless agent sessions (Claude Code subscription login or Codex CLI - no API key) through Phases 3-5b against the WorkBoard golden-path fixture in a throwaway workspace, gating each phase with `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`. Start with `--dry-run`. Not part of the installed payload; reports land under `.tmp/golden-path-runs/`.
