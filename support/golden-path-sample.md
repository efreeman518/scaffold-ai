# Golden Path Sample

Use this sample as the canonical small scaffold when validating instruction changes. It is intentionally boring: one parent entity, one child entity, SQL, Aspire, API, no optional UI/functions.

The goal is not demo breadth. The goal is repeatable proof that the instructions still produce a buildable, testable, convention-compliant .NET/Aspire/Azure scaffold.

---

## Domain Prompt

```text
Scaffold a WorkBoard app for managing work projects and work items.
Projects have a name, description, status, start date, and due date.
Work items belong to one project and have title, details, priority, status, due date, and completion date.
Users need CRUD and search for both entities.
Use row-level multi-tenancy.
No external APIs, no notifications, no UI, no Functions, no scheduler, no AI services.
```

### `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`

```markdown
# Ubiquitous Language - WorkBoard

## Accepted Terms

| Term | Type | Meaning | Code/Naming Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Project` | aggregate | Tenant-owned work container. | Use `Project` in source names. |
| `WorkItem` | entity | Trackable item of work under a project. | Use `WorkItem`; avoid `Task`. |
| `ProjectSchedule` | value-object | Project start and due date window. | Use as domain value object; flatten fields in DTOs. |
| `Draft` | state | Project has not started. | Use as project status. |
| `Active` | state | Project is in active use. | Use as project status. |
| `Completed` | state | Project work is complete. | Use as project status. |
| `Archived` | state | Project is retained but inactive. | Use as project status. |
| `New` | state | Work item not yet started. | Use as work item status. |
| `InProgress` | state | Work item actively being worked. | Use as work item status. |
| `Blocked` | state | Work item waiting on an impediment. | Use as work item status. |
| `Done` | state | Work item complete. | Use as work item status. |
| `Canceled` | state | Work item abandoned. | Use as work item status. |
| `Low` | priority | Lowest urgency. | Use as work item priority. |
| `Normal` | priority | Default urgency. | Use as work item priority. |
| `High` | priority | Elevated urgency. | Use as work item priority. |
| `Critical` | priority | Highest urgency. | Use as work item priority. |
| `ProjectNameRequired` | policy | Project must have a usable name. | Use as domain rule name. |
| `CompletedDateRequiredWhenDone` | policy | Done work items must record a completion date. | Use as domain rule name. |
| `DueDateAfterStartDate` | policy | Schedule due date is absent or after start date. | Use as value-object rule name. |
| `WorkItemBelongsToSameTenantAsProject` | policy | Work item and its project share a tenant. | Use as domain rule name. |
| `GlobalAdmin` | role | Cross-tenant administrator. | Use for global admin role. |
| `EntraID` | external-system | Enterprise identity provider. | Use in auth config. |
| `Enterprise Work Model` | external-system | Upstream enterprise ontology that `Project` specializes. | Reference only through `ontology.alignsWith`. |
| `enterprise` | auth scenario | Internal workforce auth scenario. | Use in domain spec. |

## Rejected Synonyms

| Rejected Term | Use Instead | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `Task` | `WorkItem` | Avoid .NET type collision. |

## Value Objects

| Value Object | Meaning | Fields | Used By | Equality Boundary | Validation/Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ProjectSchedule` | Project start and due date window. | `StartDate`, `DueDate` | `Project.Schedule` | both fields | `DueDateAfterStartDate` |

## Validation Commands

Run these from the generated app root.

After Phases 1-3, developer reviews the YAML artifacts (`.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml`, `.scaffold/UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md`, `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`, `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`, `.scaffold/implementation-plan.md`) against their schemas in `ai/`. Because the sample declares `ontology:`, `python {instructionsRoot}/scripts/generate-ontology.py --root . --check` must exit 0 after Phase 1 (see [ontology-projection.md](ontology-projection.md) section Check).

After Phase 4:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

After the final enabled Phase 5 sub-phase:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test .\{SolutionName}.slnx --no-build -m:1
```

Then walk through `support/final-scaffold-checklist.md`.

---

## Expected Final Shape

- `{SolutionName}.slnx` and shared .NET configuration live at the app root; production projects live under `src/`; test projects live under sibling `tests/`.
- `Project` and `WorkItem` have complete domain models, EF configurations, repositories, DTOs, mappers, services, endpoints, builders, service tests, and endpoint tests.
- Shared base types live in `<packagePrefix>.*` only (feed packages and/or `src/Packages/<packagePrefix>.*` projects per `packageStrategy`), never reimplemented in application/domain/host layers.
- `Directory.Packages.props` owns all NuGet versions (feed-supplied `<packagePrefix>.*` packages plus transitive deps).
- For `packageStrategy: feed` or `hybrid`: `nuget.config` maps `<packagePrefix>.*` to the private feed and `dotnet-ef` to `nuget.org`. For `local`: `nuget.config` only needs `nuget.org` (or may be absent).
- App starts through Aspire and API health returns 200.
- `.scaffold/ontology/` exists (the sample opts in) and `generate-ontology.py --root . --check` exits 0.
- No `NotImplementedException` remains in generated source, except inside the scaffold-skipped surface allowed by `support/final-scaffold-checklist.md` (`NoOp*` fallback stubs and base-type overrides reachable only through them).
