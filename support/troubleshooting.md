# Troubleshooting - AI Agent Triage Rules

This file is intentionally lightweight. Use it to decide **what the AI should do next** when a build/test/run problem appears.

> **For compile/run commands and engineer actions, use [execution-gates.md](execution-gates.md) as the execution checklist.**

---

## Core Rule

AI agents generate code. Engineers own environment and runtime setup.

> All code generation and fixes apply to the **new project** only. If an error points to a `patterns/` file (see `ai/SKILL.md` section Non-Negotiables for the index), document the issue in `.scaffold/INSTRUCTION-GAPS.md` (in a consumer app) or, in this repo, fold the fix directly into the owning instruction file (maintainer skill `/fold-feedback`).

When an error appears:
1. Classify it (code-generation vs infrastructure/tooling)
2. Attempt **one** code-fix pass only when it is code-generation **in the new project**
3. If still failing (or infrastructure-related), log in `HANDOFF.md` and continue with non-blocked work

---

## Narrow Before Broad

After each material change, validate at the **smallest meaningful scope first**. Only escalate to broader builds, full-system runs, or browser sessions when the narrower check passes or cannot answer the question.

Validation ladder (prefer higher rows):

| Scope | When to use |
|---|---|
| Single file / `dotnet build` one project | After editing one project's code |
| `dotnet build` solution | After cross-project changes |
| `dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=Unit"` | After logic changes |
| `dotnet test` (full suite) | After wiring / DI / integration changes |
| Host startup / Aspire run | After config, startup, or infrastructure changes |
| Browser / E2E | Only after host-level checks pass |

Do not run a full-stack validation when a targeted build or endpoint check would isolate the issue faster.

---

## AI Fixes (One Pass Max)

The AI may fix:
- Missing `using`, `ProjectReference`, or package entries
- Missing DI registration, `DbSet<>`, endpoint map, or token substitution
- Namespace/path mismatches caused by scaffolding

Then run the phase validation command and continue only if green.

---

## Engineer-Owned Issues (Do Not Diagnose Deeply)

Flag immediately for the engineer when issues involve:
- NuGet auth/feeds, Docker/container startup, SQL connectivity
- Aspire env vars/ports, Functions runtime tools/config, Playwright install
- Certificates/credentials, cloud subscription access, deployment permissions

Reference the exact relevant section in [execution-gates.md](execution-gates.md).

---

## Distributed Host Debugging: Orchestration vs Application

When a multi-host app (Aspire, Gateway, API, Scheduler) fails at runtime, **separate orchestration failures from application failures** before investigating code.

**Step 1 - Confirm the substrate is running:**
- Docker containers started? (`docker ps`)
- Aspire dashboard reachable? (check the URL from `dotnet run` output - do not reuse a prior session's URL)
- All registered resources show healthy in the dashboard?
- Gateway/proxy routes respond (even with 401/404)?

**Step 2 - Only then investigate application-level concerns:**
- API returns expected status codes?
- Auth tokens/claims correct?
- Seed/migration data present?
- Config values (connection strings, feature flags) populated?

If Step 1 fails, the problem is infrastructure - flag for the engineer per [execution-gates.md](execution-gates.md). Do not debug application code when the host substrate is not ready.

---

## Docker / Container Runtime (Aspire + Testcontainers)

The Aspire mesh tier (`Test.Aspire`) and the Testcontainers tiers (`Test.Integration`, `Test.E2E`) need a working container runtime. Diagnose it by **capability, not product**.

**Detect by capability, not by Docker Desktop.** Any runtime exposing a working Docker CLI + socket is valid - Docker Desktop, WSL Docker Engine, Rancher Desktop, or a Podman-compatible Docker socket. Confirm capability, not which product is installed:

```powershell
docker version              # client and server both report
docker info                 # daemon reachable
docker run --rm hello-world # pull + run actually works
```

If those three succeed, the runtime is usable - do not special-case the product.

**Resource pressure is the first suspect for flapping health.** Aspire mesh containers (SQL Server, Service Bus emulator, Azurite) are memory-hungry. Recommended floor: **4 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 4 GB swap**. When SQL or Service Bus health checks flap, time out, or pass only intermittently, suspect container resource pressure **before** changing test logic, timeouts, or assertions - an under-provisioned runtime looks exactly like a flaky test.

**WSL-only Docker:** check `~/.wslconfig` and raise the floor:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=8GB
processors=4
swap=4GB
```

After editing `.wslconfig`, the change is not live until the WSL VM and the Docker engine restart:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
# then restart Docker Desktop / the Docker service / the daemon
```

**Order of remediation - never reboot or edit Docker Desktop settings first.** Confirm capability (`docker info`), then resources (`.wslconfig` / engine limits), then the WSL/engine restart above - in that order. Never edit Docker Desktop settings unless the user explicitly asks, and never require a machine reboot as the first fix.

---

## Standalone Dev (Without Aspire / Docker)

Aspire AppHost injects connection strings at runtime via environment variables. When running individual host projects directly (`dotnet run` or VS F5 without AppHost), those env vars are absent and the app fails with SQL connectivity errors.

For each host that needs a database, add real values to `appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "{App}DbContextTrxn": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database={App};Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true",
    "{App}DbContextQuery": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database={App};Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

For Functions, use `local.settings.json` `ConnectionStrings` section (same values).

LocalDB (`MSSQLLocalDB` instance) ships with Visual Studio. Start it with `sqllocaldb start MSSQLLocalDB` if it is not running. EF migrations run automatically on first API startup.

> **Security:** `appsettings.Development.json` with LocalDB strings is safe to commit. Never commit cloud/staging connection strings - use user secrets or environment variables instead.

**Step 3 - After fixing an infrastructure startup issue, verify at the data plane:**
Process liveness and clean logs are necessary but not sufficient. When a fix targets a component that creates or seeds backing data (migrations, seed tasks, scheduler tables, queue metadata), perform one direct data-plane check before declaring the fix complete:
- **Database:** query for expected tables, seed rows, or schema objects
- **Queue/bus:** confirm the queue or topic exists and is reachable
- **Storage:** verify the container or blob artifact was created

This prevents false-positive fixes where the crash is resolved but the intended persistence or seeding outcome was never achieved.

---

## Third-Party Operational Store Schema Triage

When a third-party library (scheduler, queue, dashboard, job runner) uses EF-backed or SQL-backed operational tables and startup or seeding fails:

1. **Identify the schema owner.** The app owns third-party operational schema through an app-owned migration context applied by the migrator host (see [data-persistence-advanced.md](data-persistence-advanced.md) -> Third-Party Operational Store Schemas). If the library is instead auto-creating tables at startup, that is the defect - disable it and add the migration target.
2. **Do not conflate startup success with schema presence.** Many libraries start without error even when their backing tables are missing - failures appear later during seeding, first job execution, or dashboard queries, and are easily misread as connection or configuration issues.
3. **Verify the schema directly.** Query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` or the database tool of your choice to confirm the expected tables exist before investigating application-level failures. Then confirm the migrator ran (its history table, e.g. `Scheduler.__EFMigrationsHistory_TickerQ`, has rows) and that the host's startup validation is wired.
4. **Record the schema ownership model** in `HANDOFF.md` and `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` so future sessions do not re-diagnose the same issue.

## WASM Static Web Assets Manifest Crash

**Symptom:** Uno WASM app crashes on startup with `DirectoryNotFoundException` or `FileNotFoundException` referencing a deleted folder (e.g., `playwright-screenshots/`, `test-results/`).

**Root cause:** The static web assets manifest (`staticwebassets.build.json` in `obj/`) caches references to all directories present at build time. If a directory is deleted after a build but before a clean rebuild, the manifest still references it, and `WasmAppHost` crashes trying to serve assets from the missing path.

**Fix:**
1. Clean `bin/` and `obj/` folders: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force bin, obj`
2. Rebuild: `dotnet build`
3. If the deleted folder was test output or tooling artifacts, add it to `.gitignore` to prevent recurrence.

**Prevention:** Never create transient output directories (test results, screenshots, build artifacts) inside the Uno app project. Configure tools to write outputs into their own project directories (e.g., Playwright `outputDir` pointing to `tests/Test.PlaywrightUI/test-results`). Use an absolute, CWD-independent path so the location is deterministic regardless of where the tool is invoked: `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)` for MSBuild-driven output, or walk up to the repo-root `*.slnx`/`*.sln` marker for standalone runners. From that discovered repo root, append `tests/...` for test artifacts and `src/...` for product code; do not treat the repo root as the old `src/` solution root or append `Test/...` directly. Keep any environment-variable override as the first choice; only fix the fallback path.

## WASM Runtime/Class Library Mismatch

**Symptom:** Browser console reports `Your mono runtime and class libraries are out of sync` and names `System.Private.CoreLib.dll`.

**Likely root cause:** Mixed browserwasm output. The target `bin/<configuration>/<tfm>-browserwasm` was rebuilt, but target `obj/<configuration>/<tfm>-browserwasm` still contains stale WebCIL/runtime intermediates.

**Fix:**
1. Delete both target directories:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src/UI/{Project}.Uno/bin/Debug/{tfm}-browserwasm
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src/UI/{Project}.Uno/obj/Debug/{tfm}-browserwasm
   ```
2. Restore/build the Uno project:
   ```powershell
   dotnet restore src/UI/{Project}.Uno/{Project}.Uno.csproj -p:BuildAllUnoTargets=true -p:EnableUnoWasm=true
   dotnet build src/UI/{Project}.Uno/{Project}.Uno.csproj -p:TargetFrameworkOverride={tfm}-browserwasm -p:EnableUnoWasm=true --no-restore -m:1
   ```

Do not switch renderers, change launch ports, or rewrite app startup before ruling this out.

---

## Aspire Multi-Consumer Database Wiring

**Symptom:** A project that should connect to an Aspire-managed database fails with connection errors, while other consumers of the same database work fine.

**Root cause:** Each Aspire resource consumer needs its own `.WithReference()` call. When two projects need the same database but use different connection string names (e.g., API uses `{App}DbContextTrxn` and Functions uses `{App}DbContextQuery`), each must specify its connection name explicitly:

```csharp
var taskflowDb = builder.AddSqlServer("sql")
    .WithImageTag("<resolved-stable-sql-tag>")
    .AddDatabase("taskflow-db");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.TaskFlow_Api>("api")
    .WithReference(taskflowDb);  // uses default connection name

var functions = builder.AddProject<Projects.TaskFlow_Functions>("functions")
    .WithReference(taskflowDb, connectionName: "TaskFlowDbContextQuery");  // explicit name
```

Without the explicit `connectionName`, the Functions project falls back to `appsettings.json` (which may reference LocalDB or a non-existent server).

---

## Upstream Issue Diagnosis Discipline

When consulting upstream GitHub issues, PRs, or release notes to diagnose a third-party library failure:

1. **Extract the specific failure class** the upstream material addresses before applying its fix. Design-time migration problems, host-lifecycle startup problems, schema-default problems, and runtime missing-table problems are **separate fault domains** - treat them as distinct until proven otherwise.
2. **Match, don't pattern-match.** An upstream issue is relevant only if its failure mode matches your local failure mode, not just the library or feature area. A migration-generation fix does not resolve a runtime missing-table error, even if both involve the same library.
3. **Use upstream material to refine the diagnosis, not to short-circuit it.** If an upstream issue narrows the problem to a specific version, config flag, or code path, use that to focus your investigation - do not copy the fix verbatim without verifying the preconditions match.

---

## Domain Ambiguity Defaults

When inputs are unclear, prefer pragmatic defaults and continue:
- Relationship unclear -> default to one-to-many and note assumption
- Missing properties -> add `Name`; add `TenantId` when tenant-scoped
- Lite mode + Gateway requested -> keep Lite baseline; suggest Gateway as a later increment

### Quick Reference

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Search returns empty/0 results | `SearchRequest.PageSize` defaults to 0 | Send a nonzero `PageSize` (e.g. 100) and a `PageIndex` valid for the base the repo expects - see the `PageIndex pitfall` note in [repository-template.md](../templates/repository-template.md) |
| Search returns 500 / negative OFFSET | `PageIndex = 0` reaches `ComposeIQueryable` (which does `pageIndex - 1`) without a guard | Guard in the repo with `Math.Max(1, request.PageIndex)`; see the `PageIndex pitfall` note in [repository-template.md](../templates/repository-template.md) |
| Search returns a near-empty page and/or `Total = -1` for a normal `PageIndex=1, PageSize=20` request | `QueryPageProjectionAsync` called **positionally**: `pageSize`/`pageIndex` swapped and/or `includeTotal:false` passed by position. In-memory and mocked-repo tests never catch this | Call with **named arguments** (`readNoLock:`, `pageSize:`, `pageIndex:`, `includeTotal:true`); add a `Test.Integration` search test against real SQL asserting the page **and** `Total` - see the "Call it with named arguments" note in [repository-template.md](../templates/repository-template.md) |
| Search/list returns generic 500; server exception says LINQ expression could not be translated | Predicate uses member access on a value-converted property (`e.TenantId.Value`, `u.Email.Value.Contains(...)`) | Reproduce the predicate against the real SQL provider, read the actual `InvalidOperationException`, then build typed IDs/value objects outside the expression and compare the whole property (`e.TenantId == tenantId`, `u.Email == email`) |
| Same EF translation bug appears in one failing endpoint | The same boundary antipattern is usually copied into latent query/message paths without direct E2E coverage | Sweep all `ListAsync`, `Where`, `Any`, `First`, `Single`, `QuerySpec`, search handler, and message-handler predicates for the same pattern and fix the class, not only the failing call path |
| Tenant-scoped queries return empty | `IRequestContext.TenantId` is null in test host | Override request context with fixed `TestTenantId` |
| All writes return `NotImplementedException` | Wrong `SaveChangesAsync` overload used | Use the two-parameter overload; normal application writes use `SaveChangesAsync(OptimisticConcurrencyWinner.Throw, ct)` |
| Delete test passes but entity still exists | `Delete(entity)` not called | Call `repoTrxn.Delete(entity)` before save |
| FK violation in assign/reference tests | FK uses random GUID not existing row | Create related records first |
| Rate-limited 429 in integration tests | API rate limiter enabled in test host | Override limiter to `GetNoLimiter` in test factory |
| `CS0104` RequestContext ambiguity | `Test.Support` and `EF.Common.Contracts` both define type | Use fully qualified `EF.Common.Contracts.RequestContext<...>` |
| Audit save succeeds but handler side effect never happens | `AuditInterceptor` publishes to `IInternalMessageBus`, but the host is missing channel-queue support, the handler is not in DI, or handler assemblies were never registered into the bus | Register `AddChannelBackgroundTaskQueueWithShutdownHandling()` + `IInternalMessageBus` before DbContexts, add each `IMessageHandler<T>` to DI, then call `app.AutoRegisterMessageHandlers()` after `Build()`. See [bootstrapper.md](../skills/bootstrapper.md) and [message-handler-template.md](../templates/message-handler-template.md). |
| `IInternalMessageBus` resolution error in test factory | `AuditInterceptor` registered by Bootstrapper, not removed by test DB swap | Remove `AuditInterceptor<string, Guid?>` and all pool/factory descriptors. See [test-templates-endpoint.md](../templates/test-templates-endpoint.md) -> *Shared WebApplicationFactoryBase*. |
| `Cannot consume scoped from singleton IDbContextPool` in tests | `AddDbContext` registers scoped options; original pooled factory registration still present | Remove `IDbContextPool<T>` descriptors (match by `ServiceType.FullName.Contains("DbContextPool")`) before re-registering |
| `DbContextOptions must be DbContextOptions<T>` in tests | Multiple contexts sharing non-generic `DbContextOptions` constructor | Build typed options per context via `new DbContextOptionsBuilder<T>().UseInMemoryDatabase(name).Options` |
| `CS9035` required member `AuditId` not set | `DbContextBase` declares `required` members; `new` operator enforces at compile time | In WAF-based tests the package base (`EfWebApplicationFactoryBase`, EF.IntegrationTesting) already creates contexts via reflection; for hand-built fixtures construct via object initializer - see [test-templates-integration.md](../templates/test-templates-integration.md) |
| Create returns 201 but validation test expects 400 | DTO fields not applied to entity after create | Call `entity.Update(...)` after factory create |
| Create/Update NullReferenceException in tests | `UpdateFromDto` not mocked | Mock `repoTrxn.UpdateFromDto(...)` to return `DomainResult<T>.Success(entity)` |
| `CS1929` ReturnsAsync type mismatch on search mock | Query repo interface returns `PagedResponse<EntityDto>` but test uses `PagedResponse<Entity>` | Change mock to use DTO type - repos project to DTOs via `QueryPageProjectionAsync` |
| Manual Skip/Take/Count in query repo | Not using `QueryPageProjectionAsync` from RepositoryBase | Replace with `QueryPageProjectionAsync` + mapper projector + `BuildFilter`/`BuildOrderBy` methods |
| Schema changes not reflected in TestContainer | Previous schema persists | `EnsureDeletedAsync()` before `EnsureCreatedAsync()` |
| Aspire mesh failure buried in unreadable TRX | Resource logging floods test output | State/health/exit/timestamps are on by default. Re-enable raw logs only for this run with `{APP}_ASPIRE_RESOURCE_LOGGING=true`. See [test-templates-aspire.md](../templates/test-templates-aspire.md) -> *State diagnostics on by default; resource logs optional*. |
| Aspire/DCP produces no console output and every named resource immediately reports `FailedToStart` without an exit code | Orchestrator failed before launching an application process; this is distinct from an app crash | Bound the startup, dump named-resource state, and verify that no process/log directory was created. A conditional mitigation may retry one fresh host once for this exact state and then report it unavailable; include the upstream condition and removal criterion. Any exit code, unhealthy started resource, or different exception remains red. Never classify a generic timeout alone as unavailable. |
| Azure Aspire SQL graph fails while the SQL parent is healthy and a child database health probe runs before database creation | Child-resource readiness ordering in the orchestrator/integration, not an application assertion | Capture parent and child resource state plus the first probe error, reproduce on the current stable integration, and keep the lane blocked explicitly. Do not weaken database readiness, add sleeps, or roll back packages unless the alternate version changes the reproduction. |
| Recurrence/expiry/retention test changes counts between identical runs | Expected window uses `TimeProvider.System`, so the boundary moves during the test | Inject a fixed `TimeProvider` into the handler/service and derive both setup data and expected results from that instant. Keep startup timeout measurement monotonic and separate from business time. |
| Mobile/browser UI tests pass by script but do not run from Visual Studio | IDE profile does not enable/serialize the heavy lanes or own their local host lifecycle | Select the checked-in `tests/{App}.runsettings` profile when provided. It sets `MaxCpuCount=1` and explicitly enables mobile; the mobile assembly host may build the default APK and own loopback Appium, while the explicit runner still owns emulator/device preflight. |
| ProblemDetails stack traces leak in CI | Debug diagnostics enabled in all builds | Wrap diagnostic customization in `#if DEBUG` |
| StructureValidator not found | Missing static validator namespace import | Add `using {Namespace}.Application.Services.Validation;` |
| WASM build `DirectoryNotFoundException` (`unoresizetizer`) | Resizetizer manifest-path issue | See fix snippet in `skills/ui-uno-platforms.md` -> *UnoSplashScreen WASM Build Failure* |
| WASM browser reports mono runtime/class libraries out of sync | Target `obj/<config>/<tfm>-browserwasm` contains stale WebCIL/runtime intermediates after only `bin` was rebuilt | Delete both target `bin` and target `obj`; restore/build with `TargetFrameworkOverride=<tfm>-browserwasm` and `-m:1` |
| WasmUI tests look dead in Test Explorer | Harness requires `{APP}_WASM_TESTS_ENABLED=true` instead of default-on false-only opt-out | Treat only `{APP}_WASM_TESTS_ENABLED=false` as opt-out; missing Docker is `Assert.Inconclusive`, Docker present starts Aspire |
| WasmUI startup hangs with no useful failure | Long steps lack per-step timeouts/progress logs and browser diagnostics | Add bounded startup steps plus console/page error/request/HTML/script/canvas/body/bridge-state diagnostics |
| WasmUI passes locally but fails under VS coverage/profiler | Test runner profiler env vars leak into child `dotnet restore` / `dotnet build` | Clear `CORECLR_*`, `COR_*`, and Coverlet profiler vars for child processes; set profiling disabled flags |
| `NotSupportedException` deserializing `Result<T>` in tests | `Result<T>` lacks parameterless constructor | Use `JsonDocument` parsing instead of `ReadFromJsonAsync<Result<T>>()`. Search endpoints serialize just the `PagedResponse<T>` value, not the wrapper. |
| Aspire dashboard never opens / blank terminal | Missing `Properties/launchSettings.json` in AppHost | Create launchSettings.json with OTLP endpoints - see [aspire.md](../skills/aspire.md) -> Preflight |
| `MSB4057` "GetTargetPath" target missing | Uno.Sdk project referenced directly from AppHost | Remove the direct Uno ProjectReference/AddProject and register the ASP.NET Core `{Project}.Uno.WasmHost` wrapper instead |
| Functions storage/messaging clients refuse `127.0.0.1:10000/10001/10002` | `local.settings.json` fallbacks (`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`, empty Service Bus strings) beat Aspire-injected env values; Azurite under Aspire uses dynamic ports | Give Functions its own `.WithReference(...)` / host storage wiring and resolve shared client connection strings env-first before `local.settings.json` fallbacks. See [function-app.md](../skills/function-app.md) -> Aspire Integration and [aspire.md](../skills/aspire.md) -> Azure Service Bus Topics and Subscriptions. |
| Audit rows show wrong user id / correlation id looks like the audit id | `RequestContext` constructor arguments were passed in the wrong order | Use `new RequestContext<string, Guid?>(correlationId, auditId, tenantId, roles)`. See [api-host-wiring.md](../patterns/api-host-wiring.md) -> Request Context Resolution. |
| Every UI-driven create hits the user/tenant FK; create DTO has empty `TenantId`/owner | Nothing stamps identity server-side, and the dev principal carries no tenant/role (handler emits `"roles"` not `ClaimTypes.Role`, no `userTenantId`) | Stamp owner+tenant from `IRequestContext` on the create path; align `ScaffoldAuthHandler` claim types to the reader; seed a fixed dev user. See [api-host-wiring.md](../patterns/api-host-wiring.md) -> Dev-Mode Write Identity and [identity-management.md](../skills/identity-management.md) -> Claim-type contract. |
| UI-driven create returns 400, request never reaches the API (identical payload direct-to-gateway succeeds) | MudBlazor dialog interaction + Refit `AddStandardResilienceHandler` short-circuits before the call | Drive **writes through the API/gateway** in tests, not the browser dialog. Reserve browser-driven writes for render/interaction checks. See [test-templates-e2e.md](../templates/test-templates-e2e.md) -> *Prefer the API/gateway path for write assertions*. |
| Playwright `fill` leaves the field blank on submit / create posts empty values | `@bind-Value` commits on blur; a programmatic fill does not blur the field | Set `Immediate="true"` on the input (or trigger a blur in the test). See [ui-blazor-forms.md](../skills/ui-blazor-forms.md) -> *Editable Forms*. |
| Event contracts drift between layers (Domain vs Application) | Bus payload records defined in `Domain.*.Events` and/or publisher still named `IDomainEventPublisher` | Move cross-process payloads to `Application.Contracts.Events` and publish through `IIntegrationEventPublisher`. Keep domain events in Domain only for aggregate-local invariants/dispatch. |
| EF `fail:` log spam on every scheduler/host restart | Runtime host runs CREATE/schema-patch statements against existing tables | Runtime hosts never create or patch schema - move the store to an app-owned migration context in the migrator host and validate-only at startup. See [data-persistence-advanced.md](data-persistence-advanced.md) -> Third-Party Operational Store Schemas |
| `MSB3027` file lock / build fails with PID holding DLL | Orphaned `dotnet.exe` from prior run | `Get-Process -Name dotnet` then `Stop-Process -Name dotnet -Force` |
| Full-solution build fails intermittently with the WASM/browser UI output DLL locked (VBCSCompiler) | The WASM/browser UI build target locks its output DLL; concurrent full-solution builds collide on it | Build per-project, or run `dotnet build-server shutdown` before a full-solution build. See [execution-gates.md](execution-gates.md). |
| SQL container starts but auth fails under Aspire | `sql-password` parameter not in user secrets | `dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:sql-password" "<pw>" --project AppHost` |
| UI pager shows wrong "current page" / Next returns same rows | A hand-rolled client `PagedResponse.PageIndex` setter adds/removes an offset against the server-echoed value | Reuse `EF.Common.Contracts` `PagedResponse<T>` instead of redefining it; pass `pageIndex` through unchanged. Verify the API's base empirically. See [ui-uno-mvux.md](../skills/ui-uno-mvux.md) -> *Pagination contract* |
| Checklist/child state (e.g. `IsCompleted`) lost on new-parent save | UI does separate `ParentService.Create` then per-child `ChildService.Create` loop; server's `Child.Create(...)` factory doesn't accept the field | Bundle children into parent DTO for a single-payload save; Updater `createFunc` calls `Update()` after `Create()` for fields not in the factory signature. See [updater-template.md](../templates/updater-template.md) -> *createFunc must apply ALL DTO fields* and [ui-uno-mvux.md](../skills/ui-uno-mvux.md) -> *Buffered Child Items in Create Mode* |
| Menu click stays on stacked sub-page (detail) / no-ops | Navigating against the wrong navigator: a rooted `/Main/{sibling}` walks up to Shell's `FrameNavigator` (already on Main) and no-ops, while a relative route on the parent can report success without flipping sibling `Visibility` | Target the **inner** Visibility-region navigator (`RootGrid.Navigator()`) with a **relative** route, then run `ForceSiblingVisibility` and pop each FrameView's inner Frame. Never use a rooted `/Main/X` for sibling switching. See [ui-uno-navigation.md](../skills/ui-uno-navigation.md) -> *Menu Navigation: Always Land On Top Page* |
| `Assert.IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo` reports "Actual value <1> is not greater than or equal to expected value <2>" | Args inverted - signature is `(lowerBound, value)` (asserts `value >= lowerBound`) | Reorder: `Assert.IsGreaterThanOrEqualTo(lowerBound: 1, value: summary.OverdueTasks)` |
| Mock-data assertion break when seed rows are added (`Expected:<3> Actual:<14>`) | Tests hardcode absolute counts/positions against a moving mock seed | Prefer `IsNotEmpty`, `Assert.Contains`, or assertions on a specific entity Id; reserve exact counts for sealed fixtures |
| Aspire test suite hangs indefinitely | `[assembly: DoNotParallelize]` + no `[Timeout]` on a single hanging test blocks entire run | Add `[Timeout(300000)]` (5 min) to every Aspire integration test method; `[Timeout(120000)]` for Testcontainers-SQL-only tests |
| Aspire mesh tests take 5-10 min or hang on startup | `TASKFLOW_ASPIRE_TESTING` env var not set before `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync` - full environment (CosmosDB emulator etc.) starts | Set the env var inside `Test.Aspire`'s `AspireTestHost.EnsureStartedAsync` (via the `EnvironmentVariableScope` it opens) **before** `CreateAsync`; provide `AppHost/appsettings.Testing.json` with required parameters |
| Multiple Aspire environments started per test run (slow: ~60-90 s per class) | `DistributedApplication` started per class instead of shared | Start once via the shared lazy `AspireTestHost.EnsureStartedAsync` (called from each mesh class's `[ClassInitialize]`, guarded by a `SemaphoreSlim`); expose `static DistributedApplication? AspireApp` - mesh classes reference it directly |
| Functions in Aspire integration tests connect to LocalDB instead of test SQL container | `local.settings.json` connection strings override Aspire-injected env vars | Remove DB connection strings from `local.settings.json`; leave only Azurite strings (e.g., `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`) |
| `CS1061` on `CreateHttpClient` / `GetConnectionStringAsync` after removing local `DistributedApplication` field | Extension methods live in `Aspire.Hosting.Testing`; removing the field caused the `using` to be deleted | Keep `using Aspire.Hosting.Testing;` in every file that calls those extension methods |
| Functions Aspire resource missing / test hangs on `func.exe` not found | Azure Functions Core Tools not on PATH, or relative Worker SDK `RunWorkingDirectory` resolved from the caller directory | Explicit `{APP}_RUN_FUNCTIONS_TESTS=false` omits the resource and marks its tests inconclusive. Otherwise missing `func` fails red with the install step. Override Worker SDK 2.0.x `RunWorkingDirectory` to an absolute Functions-project output path per [../skills/function-app.md](../skills/function-app.md); do not call `WithWorkingDirectory` on `AzureFunctionsProjectResource`. |
| Cosmos Data Explorer at `http://localhost:1234` spins forever | Emulator itself not healthy - the Data Explorer is served from the Cosmos container | Inspect Cosmos resource health and container logs first; do not assume the explorer is broken until the gateway/emulator is healthy. See [../skills/aspire.md](../skills/aspire.md) -> *Cosmos Preview Emulator + Data Explorer* |
| Storage Explorer / RedisInsight / SQL tool fails to connect after Aspire restart | Host ports not pinned - Aspire reassigned dynamic ports on the new run | Pin host ports in AppHost for non-test runs; gate explorer wiring on `if (!isTesting)`.

| Parallel test runs / CI fail with "port already in use" on SQL/Redis/Azurite | Explorer port pins leaked into test graph | Wrap pinned ports and explorer containers in `if (!isTesting)`. Tests must use Aspire-injected connection strings, not pinned ports |
| SQL / Service Bus health checks flap or time out intermittently under Aspire | Container resource pressure (under-provisioned runtime), not test logic | Raise the runtime floor (4 CPU / 8 GB / 4 GB swap); for WSL set `~/.wslconfig` then `wsl --shutdown` + restart Docker. See *Docker / Container Runtime*. Do not loosen timeouts/assertions first |
| Testcontainers / Aspire tests fail only on a non-Docker-Desktop runtime | Fixture or test probes for Docker Desktop specifically | Use a generic capability check (`docker info` / Testcontainers connect), not a product-specific probe. WSL Docker Engine, Rancher Desktop, Podman socket are all valid |

### Detailed Fix Patterns

#### 1) EF Translation 500s: Read the Real Exception, Then Sweep the Pattern

HTTP often surfaces only a generic 500. The actionable failure is server-side, usually `InvalidOperationException: The LINQ expression ... could not be translated`. Before changing code, reproduce the failing predicate against the real relational provider used by the test or app, such as resolving the real DbContext from the test factory services and running the query once against the Testcontainer.

For value-converted properties, never infer the cause from status code alone. Confirm the actual expression, then fix predicates by building typed IDs or value objects outside the expression and comparing the whole converted property. Keep `.Value` unwrapping only in domain code or post-materialization LINQ-to-objects.

After one boundary/translation bug is confirmed, sweep the codebase for the class of defect. Search repository queries, `ListAsync` predicates, `Where` / `Any` / `First` / `Single`, search handlers, message handlers, and `QuerySpec` builders. Fix every copied antipattern in one pass, including paths the current E2E failure did not hit.

#### 2) Tenant Query Filter in Tests

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IRequestContext<string, Guid?>>(provider =>
    new EF.Common.Contracts.RequestContext<string, Guid?>(
        Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), "Test.Endpoints", TestTenantId, []));
```

#### 3) SearchRequest Defaults

Always send explicit paging:

```csharp
new SearchRequest<MyFilter>
{
    PageSize = 100,
    PageIndex = 1,
    Filter = new MyFilter()
}
```

#### 4) Rate Limiter Override in Test Host

```csharp
services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.GlobalLimiter = PartitionedRateLimiter.Create<HttpContext, string>(
        _ => RateLimitPartition.GetNoLimiter("test"));
});
```

#### 5) SaveChangesAsync Overload

```csharp
await repoTrxn.SaveChangesAsync(OptimisticConcurrencyWinner.Throw, ct);
```

#### 6) ProblemDetails Debug Leak Guard

```csharp
builder.Services.AddProblemDetails(options =>
{
#if DEBUG
    options.CustomizeProblemDetails = ctx =>
    {
        // debug-only exception detail
    };
#endif
});
```

## Razor vs C# Namespace Scoping

`global using` in a `.cs` GlobalUsings.cs file applies only to C# source files - it does NOT affect Razor component C# code blocks.
For every namespace used inside a `.razor` file, add an explicit `@using Namespace.Here` in the nearest `_Imports.razor`.
Rule of thumb: if a type is used both in `.cs` service layer code AND in `.razor` pages, it needs entries in BOTH `GlobalUsings.cs` AND `_Imports.razor`.

## Inspecting private NuGet package API surfaces

When a private package's public API is unknown or differs from docs/conventions:

1. Locate the DLL: find it under `%USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\{package}\{version}\lib\`.
2. Create a throwaway console project targeting the latest stable .NET TFM:
   ```
   dotnet new console -o C:\Temp\InspectLib
   ```
3. Add a `<Reference>` to the DLL in the `.csproj`.
   Preload any dependency assemblies (e.g., `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`) with `Assembly.LoadFrom()` before calling `GetParameters()`.
4. Use `Assembly.LoadFrom(path)`, wrap `GetTypes()` in a `ReflectionTypeLoadException` catch, then iterate types/members.
5. `dotnet run` and inspect the output.

> **Note:** `Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoadFrom()` is not supported on modern .NET - use full load + exception handling instead.
> Binary text extraction (grep for strings in the DLL bytes) is useful as a quick fallback to spot type names before writing reflection code.

## Session State

When blocked, log in `HANDOFF.md` (see [template](HANDOFF.md)):
- Symptom + classification (`code-generation` or `infrastructure`)
- Current phase
- Next engineer action (link to [execution-gates.md](execution-gates.md))

If instruction gaps are discovered:
- In an installed consumer app, append to `.scaffold/INSTRUCTION-GAPS.md`. Do not modify `.instructions/` files.
- In this instruction repository, fold the fix directly into the owning instruction file (maintainer skill `/fold-feedback`).
