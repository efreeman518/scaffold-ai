# Minimum Viable Scaffold (MVS)

The shortest path from "empty repo" to "passing API with one entity" using this instruction set. Use this when you want to ship something working before deciding on optional hosts, UI, gateway, AI, or messaging.

## What MVS produces

- A single .NET API host plus Aspire AppHost with one entity (CRUD + search), one DbContext pair (Trxn + Query), repositories, mapper, validator, service, endpoints, and unit + endpoint tests.
- `scaffoldMode: api-only`. SQL runs as an Aspire-managed local container with `externalDependencyModes.sql: emulator`. No Gateway, Uno/Blazor/React UI, Function App, Scheduler, AI services, or messaging.
- Dependencies outside MVS scope use explicit no-op or deployment-only modes. Relational persistence is not lazy optional: the default AppHost supplies SQL, or a non-Aspire variant must configure an explicit reachable SQL endpoint.
- Auth runs in scaffold mode (config-driven principal). Live identity provider is deferred.

You should reach a green `dotnet build` + `dotnet test`, working `/healthz/live` plus `/healthz/ready` probes, and SQL-backed CRUD under `/api/v1/{entity-route}` in under a day of focused work. Everything beyond that is incremental.

## When to use MVS vs the full workflow

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| First time using this scaffold; want to feel the loop end-to-end | MVS |
| Internal tool, prototype, or proof-of-concept | MVS |
| Production app with known scope (gateway, UI, scheduler, etc.) | Full [phase router](../START-AI.md) |
| Adding to an already-scaffolded app | [vertical-slice-checklist.md](vertical-slice-checklist.md) |

MVS is a profile, not a separate path. After MVS finishes you can promote to a richer profile by editing `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` and running additional Phase 5 sub-phases.

## Prerequisites

Same as the [README Prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites), with these MVS-specific simplifications:

- **Skip:** Uno templates, `uno-check`, Kiota, Functions Core Tools.
- **Required:** latest stable .NET SDK, `git`, Python (for installer), and Docker for the default Aspire SQL container and SQL-backed tests. Package feed access is conditional on `packageStrategy` (chosen in Phase 2): `feed`/`hybrid` needs read access to the configured private feed (e.g., GitHub Packages for the canonical `EF.*` example); `local` needs only `nuget.org`.

## Install

```powershell
# from a clone of this instruction repo
py -3 scripts/install-to-project.py --target C:\path\to\your-app --verify
```

The `--verify` flag checks every manifest-managed file and harness block. See [install-to-project.py](../scripts/install-to-project.py) for the full integrity contract.

## The MVS prompt overlays

Six AI sessions: one per phase for Phases 1-4, plus separate sessions for Phase 5a and Phase 5b (Phase 5 always runs one sub-phase per session). MVS skips 5c, 5d, and 5e - see section Why this works.

Generic phase prompts live in [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md). For each session, paste that phase's prompt, append the MVS overlay below, fill placeholders, run the gate, update `HANDOFF.md`, and close. This file owns only the API-only, single-entity deltas.

### Phase 1 - Domain Discovery (one entity)

Paste the Phase 1 prompt from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
Mode: minimum-viable-scaffold (API-only, one entity, no optional hosts).
Set the generic prompt's entity list to exactly one entity: {EntityName} with fields {field1: type, field2: type, ...}.
Run shared-understanding-interview.md but skip branches that don't apply to a single-entity API
(messaging, scheduling, multi-host, multi-tenant unless explicitly required).
Answer no to the enterprise-model alignment question; MVS does not declare ontology: or generate .scaffold/ontology/.
Record the MVS profile in .scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md.
```

**Done when:** `.scaffold/domain-specification.yaml` defines exactly one entity. `.scaffold/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` records that this is an MVS profile.

### Phase 2 - Resource Definition (api-only)

Paste the Phase 2 prompt from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
First, resolve packageStrategy + packagePrefix (Discovery question #1):
  - feed: provide feed URL(s) + prefix (e.g., EF). Walk ef-packages-reference.md to confirm coverage; promote to hybrid if anything is missing.
  - local: provide prefix only; the scaffold generates src/Packages/<Prefix>.* for every layer in ef-packages-reference.md.
  - hybrid: feed URL(s) + prefix + localPackageLayers for layers the feed lacks.
Set scaffoldMode: api-only. Set testingProfile: minimal.
Enable Aspire and SQL only. Set sql: emulator and generate the SQL container plus AppHost connection references.
Disable: gateway, uno-ui, blazor-ui, react-ui, function-app, scheduler, multi-tenant, ai-services, messaging, caching, notifications, IaC, CI/CD, and advanced test tiers.
If the developer explicitly disables Aspire, require a configured SQL connection endpoint before Phase 5b. Do not replace relational CRUD with in-memory persistence or call SQL lazy optional.
```

**Done when:** `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` has `scaffoldMode: api-only`, exactly one entity, every capability flag explicit, `useAspire: true`, and `externalDependencyModes.sql: emulator`. It validates against `schemas/resource-implementation.schema.json`.

## Schema-valid MVS profile

All capability flags are explicit so profile drift is visible in review. Replace names and local package layers for the target app; do not add dependency versions to this artifact.

```yaml
scaffoldMode: api-only
testingProfile: minimal
functionProfile: starter
unoProfile: starter
packageStrategy: local
packagePrefix: Sample
customNugetFeeds: []
localPackageLayers: [Domain, Domain.Contracts, Data, Data.Contracts, Common, Common.Contracts]
applicationStyle: service
includeApi: true
includeGateway: false
includeFunctionApp: false
includeScheduler: false
includeUnoUI: false
includeBlazorUI: false
includeReactUI: false
includeNotifications: false
includeFlowEngine: false
flowEngineDbStrategy: same-db-separate-schema
includeIaC: false
includeGitHubActions: false
includeAzd: false
includeAiServices: false
includeKeyVault: false
useAspire: true
database: SQLServer
migrationLifecycle: preserved-append-only
databaseProviders: [SqlServer]

includeArchitectureTests: false
includeE2ETests: false
includeLoadTests: false
includeBenchmarkTests: false
includeMutationTests: false

        maxLength: 200
        required: true
aspireResources:
  - name: sql
    service: SQL Server
    appHostApi: AddSqlServer
    localMode: RunAsContainer
    publishMode: connection-string
    connectionNames: [SampleDbContextTrxn, SampleDbContextQuery]
externalDependencyModes:
  sql: emulator
  redis: no-op stub
  serviceBus: no-op stub
  eventGrid: no-op stub
  keyVault: deployment-only
  blobStorage: no-op stub
  cosmosDb: no-op stub
  aiServices: deployment-only
```

### Phase 3 - Implementation Plan

Paste the Phase 3 prompt from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
Tooling section: list only CLIs needed for an api-only scaffold (dotnet, dotnet-ef). Skip MCP discovery beyond Microsoft Docs + Context7.
```

**Done when:** the plan is reviewed, its Tooling section has no unresolved items, and the feed pre-flight passes for `feed`/`hybrid`. No solution exists to restore until Phase 4.

### Phase 4 - Contract Scaffolding

Paste the Phase 4 prompt from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
MVS scope: api-only. Skip projects for Gateway, Function App, Uno/Blazor/React UI, Scheduler.
Expected solution: Aspire AppHost, API host, Application/Domain/Infrastructure projects, Test.Support, Test.Unit, Test.Endpoints.
```

**Done when:** `dotnet build` is green and the solution contains the AppHost, API host, Application/Domain/Infrastructure projects, the three test projects, and any `src/Packages/<Prefix>.*` projects required by `packageStrategy`. No optional hosts.

### Phase 5 - Implementation (5a + 5b only for MVS)

MVS skips 5c (no optional hosts), 5d (no architecture/load/benchmark gates beyond `minimal` profile), and 5e (auth stays in scaffold mode; no AI services).

#### 5a - Foundation (TDD)

Use the Phase 5 session-start prompt plus the 5a block from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
Replace no-op repository stubs with real implementations in RegisterServices.cs.
```

#### 5b - App Core + API (TDD)

Use the Phase 5 session-start prompt plus the 5b block from [prompt-catalog.md](prompt-catalog.md), then append:

```text
Load only the api-only required entries from the 5b row.
Skip runtime concerns: gateway, multi-tenant, caching, observability, security.
Wire both DbContexts to the Aspire SQL resource and run the AppHost startup, health, and SQL-backed CRUD gate.
```

**Done when:** `dotnet build` green, `dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=Unit|TestCategory=Endpoint"` green, the AppHost starts, `/healthz/live` plus `/healthz/ready` return 200, and one SQL-backed CRUD cycle works under `/api/v1/{entity-route}`.

## "You are done" check

Run from the solution root:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet test --filter "TestCategory=Unit|TestCategory=Endpoint"
dotnet run --project src\Host\Aspire\AppHost
# Discover the API URL in the Aspire dashboard, then use it from another shell:
# GET {api-url}/healthz -> 200 OK
# GET {api-url}/healthz/ready -> 200 OK
# POST {api-url}/api/v1/{entity-route} -> 201 + Location header
```

If Aspire is deliberately disabled, configure the API's SQL connection names to an explicit reachable SQL endpoint before running it directly. Missing SQL configuration is a failed MVS prerequisite, not a lazy-optional fallback. If all checks pass, MVS is complete.

The CI `--dry-run` is an extraction smoke only: it proves prompt and YAML extraction without invoking an agent, .NET, Docker, or SQL. Before an instruction-set release, run the non-dry-run golden path with a real supported agent and retain its build, Unit, Endpoint, health, and SQL-backed CRUD results as release evidence.

## Promoting beyond MVS

When you're ready to add scope:

- **New entity:** [vertical-slice-checklist.md](vertical-slice-checklist.md) fast-path.
- **Add a runtime concern** (caching, gateway, multi-tenant, observability, security): edit `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` to enable the flag, run a 5b session loading only the new skill file.
- **Add an optional host** (Function App, Scheduler, Uno UI, Blazor UI, React UI): enable the flag in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`, run a dedicated 5c session per host.
- **Live auth or AI services:** enable in `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml`, run a 5e session.
- **Quality gates** (architecture tests, load, benchmarks): bump `testingProfile` and run a 5d session.

## Why this works

MVS is the same instruction set, scoped down. Every gate, every artifact, every conflict-precedence rule still applies - the only difference is that `.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` flags most optional surfaces off, so the per-sub-phase load sets shrink, and 5c/5d/5e can be deferred until the API is real.

If you find yourself wanting Gateway or UI or messaging mid-MVS, stop the MVS path and switch to the full [phase router](../START-AI.md). Mixing them produces incomplete artifacts.
