## Design-Time Factory

Use `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<T>` for CLI migrations. Two factories - one per context - each sets `AuditId` and `TenantId` for the `DbContextBase` tenant filter and audit infrastructure.

```csharp
[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
public class DesignTimeDbContextFactoryTrxn : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<{Project}DbContextTrxn>
{
    public {Project}DbContextTrxn CreateDbContext(string[] args)
    {
        var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EFCORETOOLSDB")
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Set EFCORETOOLSDB env var");

        var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<{Project}DbContextTrxn>();
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString, sql =>
        {
            sql.UseCompatibilityLevel(170);
            sql.MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", "{app}");
        });

        var context = new {Project}DbContextTrxn(optionsBuilder.Options);
        context.AuditId = "design-time";
        context.TenantId = Guid.Empty;
        return context;
    }
}

[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
public class DesignTimeDbContextFactoryQuery : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<{Project}DbContextQuery>
{
    public {Project}DbContextQuery CreateDbContext(string[] args)
    {
        var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EFCORETOOLSDB")
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Set EFCORETOOLSDB env var");

        var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<{Project}DbContextQuery>();
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString, sql =>
        {
            sql.UseCompatibilityLevel(170);
            sql.MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", "{app}");
        });

        var context = new {Project}DbContextQuery(optionsBuilder.Options);
        context.AuditId = "design-time";
        context.TenantId = Guid.Empty;
        return context;
    }
}
```

> **Why two factories?** EF CLI uses `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<T>` - each context type needs its own factory. Both must set `AuditId`/`TenantId` because `DbContextBase` uses these for tenant query filters and audit interceptor.
> **Why `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]`?** Design-time factories are only invoked by EF CLI tooling, never in production code paths.

## JSON Columns (`ToJson()`) Troubleshooting

`ToJson()` with owned types is the preferred pattern for structured data stored as JSON in SQL Server. EF Core may still fail to generate migrations for complex graphs with nested collections or dictionaries.

Projection trap: materializing a primitive collection inside a `ToJson()`-owned type via `.ToList()` NREs in the SQL Server shaper at shaper-build time (even on empty tables), while translating fine on Npgsql - write `new List<T>(x.Items)` instead of `x.Items.ToList()` in projections, and cover the projection on the deployed provider (see [testing.md](../skills/testing.md)).

Fallback: use a serializer-backed value conversion to `nvarchar(max)` with a custom `ValueComparer`.

```csharp
builder.Property(e => e.ComplexData)
    .HasConversion(
        v => JsonSerializer.Serialize(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null),
        v => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ComplexType>(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null)!)
    .HasColumnType("nvarchar(max)")
    .Metadata.SetValueComparer(
        new ValueComparer<ComplexType>(
            (a, b) => JsonSerializer.Serialize(a, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null) == JsonSerializer.Serialize(b, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null),
            v => JsonSerializer.Serialize(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null).GetHashCode(),
            v => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ComplexType>(JsonSerializer.Serialize(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null), (JsonSerializerOptions?)null)!));
```

If you use this fallback, record it in `HANDOFF.md` and repo docs. Do not hand-edit migration files to work around `ToJson()` failures.

---

## Migrations

### EF CLI Prerequisites

Before running any migration command, ensure `dotnet ef` is available. Prefer a repo-local tool manifest for reproducibility; an existing user-global install is acceptable only when its version is compatible with the repository.

```powershell
dotnet ef --version
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install dotnet-ef --version <same-patch-as-ef-runtime>
dotnet tool restore
```

Keep the EF runtime/provider packages, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` when referenced, and repo-local `dotnet-ef` on one compatible patch. The startup project must reference `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`. Re-run `dotnet tool restore`, a compiled migration command, and the solution build after a refresh; a green runtime-only build can miss design-time drift.

If `nuget.config` uses `<packageSourceMapping>`, add an explicit entry for `dotnet-ef` under `nuget.org`.

### Migration Naming

Format: `YYYYMMDD_Description`.

```text
20260301_InitialCreate
20260305_AddCategoryColorHex
20260310_AddTodoItemPriority
```

Never rename a migration after it has been shared with any environment or teammate.

### Migration lifecycle and provider parity

`.scaffold/resource-implementation.yaml` must declare `migrationLifecycle` and `databaseProviders` before Phase 5a changes migrations:

- `preserved-append-only` is the default and is mandatory once any teammate, shared environment, or preserved dataset depends on migration history. Existing migrations are immutable; append a new migration.
- `unreleased-resettable` is allowed only when the recorded project context confirms no compatibility or data history must survive. Baseline regeneration then requires an explicit list of affected environments, a verified backup for any data worth keeping, and a guarded reset. It is not permission to reset an environment merely because a migration is inconvenient.
- A data-preserving guarded reset has three concrete failure points, each verified against a real provider container before running destructively: the data-only dump's `COPY` column lists come from the **live** schema, so any column the new baseline dropped aborts the restore after the volume is destroyed - drop listed obsolete columns after the full backup and before the dump; refuse every destructive step when the backup did not actually run; validate identifiers against the live schema (e.g. `to_regclass`) because `ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS` exits 0 on a typo.

For multi-provider applications, generate and verify every provider named in `databaseProviders` from the same application model. Keep provider migration sets separate, run `has-pending-model-changes` for each context/provider, and regenerate each `InitialCreate` only under `unreleased-resettable`. A parity verifier may normalize only nondeterministic generated migration IDs/timestamps before diffing; it must not normalize schema, SQL, annotations, or provider-specific semantics. On drift, fail and upload regenerated files as evidence. Do not create self-modifying, self-deleting, or repository-branch workflows for routine migration repair.

### Canonical Commands

```powershell
$env:EFCORETOOLSDB = "Server=..."

dotnet ef migrations add {MigrationName} `
  --project src/Infrastructure/{Project}.Infrastructure.Data `
  --startup-project src/Host/{Host}.Api `
  --context {App}DbContextTrxn

dotnet ef database update `
  --project src/Infrastructure/{Project}.Infrastructure.Data `
  --startup-project src/Host/{Host}.Api `
  --context {App}DbContextTrxn

dotnet ef migrations script --idempotent `
  --project src/Infrastructure/{Project}.Infrastructure.Data `
  --startup-project src/Host/{Host}.Api `
  --context {App}DbContextTrxn `
  -o migrations.sql
```

### Mapping-Foundation Neutrality Gate

After any refactor to typed-ID or value-object mapping, verify that the runtime model is schema-neutral before adding or regenerating migrations:

```powershell
dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes `
  --project src/Infrastructure/{Project}.Infrastructure.Data `
  --startup-project src/Host/{Host}.Api `
  --context {App}DbContextTrxn
```

Use the same `--project` / `--startup-project` rooting that real migrations use. If the Data project itself carries the design-time factory and `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`, you may run with the Data project as startup instead. The result must be `No changes`. If EF reports pending model changes, reconcile the moved facet (max length, nullability, default value, column type, FK shape) in configuration. Do not blind-regenerate a migration for a mapping-foundation refactor.

Repeat this gate for every configured migration provider and DbContext. A green SQL Server check does not prove a PostgreSQL migration set is current, or the reverse.

### Data Migrations

Migration files should contain schema changes only. Use one-time background jobs for non-trivial backfill and use `migrationBuilder.Sql()` only for simple, safe updates.

Container image upgrades can change the database's expected persistence root without changing the EF schema. Treat a named-volume target change as a data migration: before switching it, require a verified backup plus migration/restore proof, or record that the volume is disposable. Verify known data after container recreation. A healthy replacement cluster can be newly initialized while the old volume still holds the only real data.

### Migration Ownership: Dedicated Migrator Host

**Canonical owner for migration execution.** Exactly one process owns schema: `src/Host/{App}.DatabaseMigrator`, a console host in the solution (plus a Dockerfile when the app deploys containers). Runtime hosts (API, Scheduler, Functions, workers, Gateway) never call `Database.MigrateAsync`, create schemas, or patch tables at startup. Scaled-out instances race DDL, runtime identities would need broad permissions, and startup failure modes become uncontrollable.

Runner primitives ship in EF.Data (`EF.Data.Migrations` namespace): `AddDatabaseMigrationRunner()`, `AddEfCoreMigrationTarget<TContext>(logicalName, order)`, `DatabaseMigrationRunner.RunAsync()`. Each target resolves `IDbContextFactory<TContext>` - register target contexts with `AddDbContextFactory` (the `Add{App}MigrationDbContexts` helper's job), never plain `AddDbContext`.

Sub-phase split: Phase 5a creates the initial migration files (the schema artifact); the migrator host project and the AppHost `WaitForCompletion` wiring are generated in 5b with the rest of runtime orchestration.

```csharp
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
builder.Services
    .AddDatabaseMigrationRunner()
    .Add{App}MigrationDbContexts(builder.Configuration)  // migrator-local context factories
    // Deterministic order: app schema first, then FlowEngine, then Scheduler/TickerQ.
    .AddEfCoreMigrationTarget<{App}DbContextTrxn>("{App}DbContextTrxn", 10)
    .AddEfCoreMigrationTarget<{App}FlowEngineDbContext>("{App}FlowEngineDbContext", 20)
    .AddEfCoreMigrationTarget<{App}TickerQDbContext>("{App}TickerQDbContext", 30);

using var host = builder.Build();
using var scope = host.Services.CreateScope();
await scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<DatabaseMigrationRunner>().RunAsync();
```

Rules:

- **Fail fast.** Each target logs its database + context before migrating. An unhandled failure terminates the process with nonzero exit; later targets do not run. No catch-and-ignore, no retry loops around migration ownership.
- **Migrator-only timeouts.** Long SQL command timeouts belong only in the migrator's DbContext registrations. Do not copy migration timeout defaults into API, Scheduler, Functions, or any request-path registration.
- **Schema + history isolation.** Each context keeps its own schema and migrations history table (`MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", schema)`), even when local Aspire maps every logical connection to one physical database. Configure it inside the central provider-options extension used by runtime, migrator, tests, and design-time factories. Design-time factories must match the runner configuration exactly: schema, history table, migrations assembly, provider, SQL compatibility level. Add or update the design-time factory whenever a migration target is added.
- **Npgsql requires an explicit history schema.** PostgreSQL resolves an unqualified `__EFMigrationsHistory` through `search_path`, commonly `"$user", public`. If the database user name equals the app schema, resolution changes as soon as the first migration creates that schema, and the next run can miss history and replay `InitialCreate`. Configure every Npgsql context with `npgsql.MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", schema)`; never depend on `search_path` for migration ownership.
- **Stable logical connection names.** One name per logical store: `{App}DbContextTrxn`, `{App}DbContextQuery`, `{App}FlowEngineDbContext`, `{ThirdPartyStore}DbContext`. Development config may point them all at one local database; Azure splits physical databases later through configuration only, never runtime code. Hosts fail fast when a required connection string is missing; do not infer one logical store from another (the only deliberate fallback lives in migrator-only registration).
- **Data movement is a deployment unit.** Pre/post-schema steps (C# steps needing EF services, or SQL steps for staging, backfill, compatibility copies, cleanup) run inside the migrator as ordered work, never hidden in runtime hosted services. Data that must survive between steps lives in durable staging tables in the migration schema, dropped when the migration completes - do not rely on temp tables surviving across connections.

Orchestration:

- **Local Aspire:** AppHost adds the migrator project against the same local SQL resource; every runtime host declares `.WaitForCompletion(migrator)`. One SQL resource, one physical database, multiple schemas + logical connection names - do not require multiple local SQL containers because production may split databases later.
- **Azure:** deploy infrastructure -> run the migrator once (Container Apps Job: manual trigger, parallelism `1`, replica completion count `1`, retry limit `0` unless the migration is provably restart-safe, timeout sized for data movement; the pipeline polls the job execution to terminal status) -> deploy or start runtime apps. Deployment workflow gates every runtime deploy job on migration success. Non-container hosting follows the same order: single migrator run before runtime rollout. See [cicd.md](../skills/cicd.md) section Production DB Migration (Migrator Job).
- **Identity split.** The migrator identity gets schema DDL + migration-history permissions. Runtime identities get least-privilege DML and no DDL. Entra-auth SQL connection strings do not create contained database users or grants - infra either wires SQL data-plane identities explicitly or carries a clear comment that SQL identities are not wired.

Tests (proportional to blast radius): unit tests for target ordering and fail-fast (later targets skipped after a failure); SQL integration tests applying all targets to a fresh database and running the migrator twice for idempotency; third-party schema validation failing when the schema is missing; an Aspire topology test proving runtime hosts wait on migrator completion. SQL-container tests report `Assert.Inconclusive(...)` only when a bounded Docker preflight proves no compatible runtime is available. Once preflight succeeds, container startup failures are red with captured state/log diagnostics. Integration/E2E fixtures prepare the database explicitly (direct `MigrateAsync` in test setup) before booting runtime hosts.

**TaskFlow proof:** `src/Host/TaskFlow.DatabaseMigrator/Program.cs` (ordered targets, migrator-only timeouts, per-target history tables), `src/Host/Aspire/AppHost/AppHost.cs` (`WaitForCompletion`), `infra/modules/container-app-job.bicep` + `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (one-shot job gating runtime rollout), `tests/Test.Unit/Infrastructure/DatabaseMigrationRunnerTests.cs`.

### Third-Party Operational Store Schemas

Libraries like TickerQ, Hangfire, or Quartz persist operational tables through their own EF model but do not ship bundled migrations. Give each an app-owned migration context; never let runtime startup auto-create or patch third-party schema, and keep any library `AutoCreateSchema`/deployment-script feature off in production.

Shape (TickerQ example):

- `{App}TickerQDbContext` - app-owned context exposing the library's model, with a dedicated schema (`Scheduler`) and history table (`Scheduler.__EFMigrationsHistory_TickerQ`).
- Generated migrations live under a separate folder (`Migrations/TickerQ`) with an explicit migrations assembly, so third-party operational schema never mixes with app domain migrations.
- Registered as an ordered target in the migrator host (see <Migration Ownership: Dedicated Migrator Host>); the design-time factory matches the target configuration.
- The scheduler host validates required tables exist at startup and fails fast when missing - it does not create them. The scheduler uses its own logical operational-store connection string; app domain connection strings stay reserved for domain work.
- Prefer an explicit app-owned context name over a library-provided context name - upstream design-time context discovery is unreliable in fresh projects. Prove `dotnet ef migrations add` plus a real SQL apply before treating the integration as done.

**TaskFlow proof:** `src/Infrastructure/TaskFlow.Infrastructure.Data/TaskFlowTickerQDbContext.cs`, `TaskFlowTickerQSchemaValidator.cs`, `Migrations/TickerQ/`, scheduler validation in `src/Host/TaskFlow.Scheduler/RegisterSchedulerServices.cs`.

### Zero-Downtime Schema Changes

Use expand/contract:

1. Expand: add nullable/defaulted shape, deploy code that writes both old and new.
2. Backfill: migrate existing data.
3. Contract: remove old shape in a later deployment.

Never combine expand and contract in one deployment.

### Rollback Strategy

Development:

```powershell
dotnet ef database update {PreviousMigrationName} `
  --context {App}DbContextTrxn
```

Production:

- Use idempotent forward-only scripts.
- Prefer blue-green deployment.
- Never delete a migration applied to any shared environment.

### Multi-Store Consistency

For SQL + Cosmos/Table hybrids:

1. EF migrations apply to SQL only.
2. Document stores evolve through code and defaults.
3. Deploy tolerant code before the SQL migration.

---

## Always Encrypted (Column-Level Encryption)

Load when a Phase 1 Security-branch decision protects a `sensitive` property with SQL Always Encrypted (SQL Server / Azure SQL only). Trigger and mode choice live in [../ai/shared-understanding-interview.md](../ai/shared-understanding-interview.md) section Sensitive-Data Trigger. This section is the how.

### Storage shape: `varbinary(200)` + UTF8 converter

Map the domain property as a plain `string`; store it as `varbinary(200)` with a UTF8 value converter. This keeps the domain model primitive and sidesteps the `Latin1_General_BIN2` collation that deterministic **string** columns otherwise require (varbinary has no collation). EF bypasses the converter on `null`, so the columns stay nullable.

```csharp
builder.Property(e => e.SecureDeterministic)
    .HasConversion(v => Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(v!), v => Encoding.UTF8.GetString(v))
    .HasColumnType("varbinary(200)");
```

Give the domain a UTF8 byte budget matching the column (e.g. `RULE_SECURE_PROPERTY_MAX_BYTES = 200`) and validate against it in the domain rule - the encrypted ciphertext must fit the declared column width.

### EF has no fluent Always Encrypted mapping

There is no `.IsEncrypted()`. The CMK/CEK creation and `ALTER COLUMN ... ENCRYPTED WITH` are raw SQL that must run inside the migration. Do **not** re-derive the T-SQL - `EF.Data` ships a `MigrationSupport` helper. In the migration's `Up`, after `CreateTable`, call a private `ConfigureAlwaysEncrypted(migrationBuilder)`:

```csharp
var support = new MigrationSupport(migrationBuilder, new DefaultAzureCredential());
support.CreateColumnMasterKey(urlAkvCmk, "CMK_WITH_AKV");
support.CreateColumnEncryptionKey(urlAkvCmk, "CMK_WITH_AKV", "CEK_WITH_AKV");
// varbinary has no collation -> collate: null. encType per field: DETERMINISTIC (queryable) or RANDOMIZED (default).
support.AlterColumnEncryption("CEK_WITH_AKV", "[schema].[Table]", "[SecureDeterministic] varbinary(200)", collate: null, encType: "DETERMINISTIC");
support.AlterColumnEncryption("CEK_WITH_AKV", "[schema].[Table]", "[SecureRandom] varbinary(200)", collate: null, encType: "RANDOMIZED");
```

### Local-green invariant: gate the AKV setup

There is **no Key Vault emulator** - the CMK is a hard cloud dependency (the local SQL container is fine; crypto is client-side). Gate the migration setup behind `SKIP_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED_SETUP` so build/test/local-Aspire need no Azure and columns stay plain `varbinary(200)`:

```csharp
private static void ConfigureAlwaysEncrypted(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
{
    // Default: skip. Only an explicit SKIP_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED_SETUP=false runs the AKV setup.
    if (!string.Equals(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SKIP_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED_SETUP"), "false", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        return;
    var urlAkvCmk = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AKVCMKURL")
        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("AKVCMKURL required when SKIP_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED_SETUP=false.");
    // ... MigrationSupport calls above ...
}
```

Make the full path opt-in at the AppHost via `TASKFLOW_ENABLE_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED=true` (which wires `AKVCMKURL` and flips the migrator gate); leave it unset for normal local work.

### Runtime wiring (behind the same opt-in)

Gated by config `Database:AlwaysEncrypted:Enabled` (env `TASKFLOW_ENABLE_ALWAYS_ENCRYPTED`):

- Append `;Column Encryption Setting=Enabled` to the connection string (idempotent - skip if already present).
- Register the AKV provider **once per process** in a `try/catch`. `SqlConnection.RegisterColumnEncryptionKeyStoreProviders` has no is-registered check and throws on a second registration (matters under `WebApplicationFactory` reuse). Guard with a static bool and swallow the double-register throw:

```csharp
try
{
    SqlConnection.RegisterColumnEncryptionKeyStoreProviders(customProviders: new Dictionary<string, SqlColumnEncryptionKeyStoreProvider>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
        { { SqlColumnEncryptionAzureKeyVaultProvider.ProviderName, new SqlColumnEncryptionAzureKeyVaultProvider(new DefaultAzureCredential()) } });
}
catch { /* already registered; SqlClient offers no is-registered check, once-per-process */ }
```

### Infrastructure checklist (beyond secrets)

Key-Vault-as-secrets is **not** sufficient. Add:

- an **RSA CMK key** resource in Key Vault (not a secret);
- `enablePurgeProtection: true` (**irreversible** - warn before enabling);
- **Key Vault Crypto User** RBAC (Secrets User is not enough): the **migrator** identity needs `sign` + `wrapKey`, the **runtime** identities need `unwrapKey`. Wire both explicitly (the migrator/runtime identity split is the same one from Migration Ownership).

### Migration hygiene

Prefer a **dedicated additive migration** (let EF auto-generate the model snapshot) over hand-editing a shipped migration. If hand-editing the migration + designer + snapshot is unavoidable, require a drift check before treating it done:

```powershell
dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes --context {App}DbContextTrxn
```

Must report `No changes` (same rooting as the Mapping-Foundation Neutrality Gate above).

### Testing expectations

Full encrypt/decrypt E2E needs a real AKV key and **cannot run locally** (no emulator). Do not attempt or claim local E2E of encryption. The runnable checks are: the **domain length/validation test** (value fits `RULE_SECURE_PROPERTY_MAX_BYTES`) and the **model-drift check** above. State this plainly rather than pretending encryption was exercised locally.

### Key rotation

CMK/CEK rotation is an operational task on top of the secret-rotation workflow in [../skills/security.md](../skills/security.md). Rotate the CMK in Key Vault, re-wrap the CEK, then retire the old CMK version; record the rotation owner in the Security-branch decision.

**TaskFlow proof:** `src/Infrastructure/TaskFlow.Infrastructure.Data/Migrations/*_InitialCreate.cs` (`ConfigureAlwaysEncrypted`), `Configurations/TaskItemConfiguration.cs` (varbinary + UTF8 converter), `src/Host/TaskFlow.Bootstrapper/Registration/RegisterServices.Database.cs` (provider registration, `Column Encryption Setting`), `src/Host/Aspire/AppHost/AppHost.cs` (opt-in gate, `AKVCMKURL`), `infra/main.bicep` (CMK key, purge protection, Crypto User RBAC), `tests/Test.Unit/Domain/TaskItemTests.cs` (domain length test). Decision recorded as D-019 (Branch Security).

---

## Startup Seeding / Reference Data

Use the `IStartupTask` pattern for idempotent seed data after `app.Build()` and before `app.RunAsync()`.

```csharp
public class SeedReferenceDataTask : IStartupTask
{
    private readonly IDbContextFactory<{App}DbContextTrxn> _factory;

    public SeedReferenceDataTask(IDbContextFactory<{App}DbContextTrxn> factory)
        => _factory = factory;

    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await using var db = await _factory.CreateDbContextAsync(ct);

        var existing = (await db.Set<{Entity}>()
            .Where(e => e.IsSystem)
            .Select(e => e.Id)
            .ToListAsync(ct)).ToHashSet();

        var seeds = {Entity}Seeds.All
            .Where(s => !existing.Contains(s.Id));

        foreach (var seed in seeds)
        {
            db.Set<{Entity}>().Add(seed);
        }

        await db.SaveChangesAsync(true, ct);
    }
}
```

Seeding rules:

- Seed deterministically with fixed GUIDs.
- Check existence before insert.
- Mark seeded rows with `IsSystem = true`.
- Register startup tasks in dependency order.
- Seed a well-known dev user and dev tenant with fixed compile-time GUID constants on the existing
  `SeedConstants` holder (`SeedConstants.DevUserId`, `SeedConstants.DevTenantId`). The dev write-identity
  seam stamps `SeedConstants.DevUserId` as the owner and `ScaffoldAuthHandler` emits both as claims, so
  UI-driven creates resolve the user/tenant FK with no runtime lookup. Never seed the dev principal with a random Guid -
  a random id forces a lookup and breaks the stamped FK. See
  [../patterns/api-host-wiring.md](../patterns/api-host-wiring.md) section Dev-Mode Write Identity and
  [../skills/identity-management.md](../skills/identity-management.md) section Claim-type contract.
